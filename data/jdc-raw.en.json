    "text": "In Mezam where he began his tour on March 6, the PM calls for parents to send their children to school met with outright rejections. Speaking on behalf of the North West elites at the Bamenda congress where the meeting between the PM and elites was taking place, Hon. Wilfred Fusi Naamukong, told Yang that schools can only resume when government release all Anglophone detainees, demilitarised Southern Cameroons and reinstate internet services.\u00a0The MP said government claims of engaging in dialogue with the Anglophone community are completely false given how they keep taking the dictatorial tone. In response to the MP\u2019s remarks, Yang said the government had ordered the  of Southern Cameroonians and militarized the regions because of hostile attitude of some citizens. Meanwhile in Fundong, many kom elites allegedly took the PM\u2019s question of how many people use internet in Kom as a display of stupidity, ignorance and an unpardonable insult on the Kom people. Many inhabitants of Bamenda are said to have question why the PM bothers himself with the visit to the region. The population said the PM once mentioned he is not their PM some seven years ago: The MP is quoted to have said he was appointed Prime Minister of Cameroon and not the Prime Minister of North West\u201d. The North westerners, media reports hold haven\u2019t forgotten, hence see no reason to sympathise or listen to him. For his part, John Fru Ndi, Social Democratic Front, chairman, tagged Yang\u2019s trip as a successful failure. Fru Ndi said the government can\u2019t use force to convince parents to send their children to school. \u201c The Prime Minister only ridiculed himself. He knows the problem and he just has to be truthful with the parents. They expected the head of government to come and talk to them and ask for what they wanted. He did not do it. He came to say what Biya wanted Anglophones to do, to invite the parents and pupils to resume classes. This is not the way to go. The Government must engage in  . I must say that Mr. Biya knows the problem of teachers and lawyers, \u201csaid Ni John Fru Ndi the leader of the SDF. The Prime Minister\u2019s visit to the region comes after several unsuccessful meetings with education stakeholders in the Northwest Region since November 2016, all aimed at resolving  which has crumbled\u00a0socio-economic activities in anglophone Cameroon for close to four months .",

    "text": "The Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium has reiterated its demand for the return to federalism as a system of government that would curb inequalities in the sharing of resources and political power between the minority English-speaking Cameroonians and French-speaking Cameroonians. Barrister Felix Agbor \u2018Balla\u2019 Kongho and Dr Fontem Neba, President and Secretary General of the Consortium spoke to this reporter at the Kondengui Principal Prison in Yaounde this afternoon. The duo currently charged with terrorism, rebellion and other offences have been in detention ever since they were arrested in Buea, South West region on January 17. Barrister Agbor Kongho said\u00a0the consortium which is legally registered in the United States is not party to any organisation calling for the independence of Anglophone regions. \u201cThe consortium has never changed its stance. It is true that the people\u2019s thinking might be changing, but as leaders of the Consortium, we maintain that we are for a two-state federation. However, people who are in favour or craving for independence have the right to do so, but not in the name of the Consortium\u201d Barrister Agbor Kongho stressed. It should be noted\u00a0Tassang Wilfred, programs cordinator of the Consortium and Executive Secretary General of Cameroon Teacher\u2019s Trade Union has been signing press releases from his hideout in Nigeria on behalf of the Consortium. Some of the press releases advocate independence of Southern Cameroons. He currently leads SCACUF which is a movement with one major objective- to fight for the independence of Southern Cameroons. The detained President and Secretary General of the Consortium both hold Tassang should not be mixing up his activities in SCACUF with those of the Consortium. \u201cIt is good to point out that we cannot be criticising a system or certain leadership styles and systematically building same. We have learned with disappointment that Anglophones are victimising and intimidating others on social media. A silent majority that shared the ideologies of federalism apparently would no longer speak their minds even on social media for fear of being tagged, black legs, sell outs or other bad names,\u201d Dr Fontem chipped in. Both leaders held books with their fingers between pages to mark where they left off as they chatted on the court yard of the prison. They expressed bitterness at what they both described as \u201cunacceptable levels of hate speech on social media.\u201d \u201cAnglophones and Francophones need to stop the verbal attacks on each other. Separatists and Federalists equally need to stop attacking one another. Even people who believe Cameroon should stay the way it is, have the right to their opinion. Anyone supporting intimidation and violence against people who share contrary views, should know he is grooming a monster whose existence he will regret later. We have also learned with consternation that some people are still pushing the North West- South West divide. This needs to stop immediately\u201d said Barrister Agbor Kongho. The internationally acclaimed legal mind also told  the Consortium is against any group forcing or intimidating citizens to respect ghost towns or forcing teachers and lawyers to respect the on-going strike. \u201cPeople are supposed to be educated. When they understand the reasons for the strike and find it important to be part of it, they will support it. The use of force or violence is out of place\u201d said he. To Dr Fontem Neba, it is possible that not all forms of violence recorded during the on-going strike are carried out by over-excited youths or people pushing the independence agenda. \u201cIn a situation like this, it is important to note that the government could stage an attack on innocent citizens in order to justify its use of force on protesters\u201d said he. \u201cPermit restate that we are against all forms of violence. We are leaders of a legal organisation and we are not for disintegration of the country\u201d Besides leading the Consortium created to speak and negotiate with government on behalf of English-speaking Cameroon, Barrister Felix Agbor \u2018Balla\u2019 doubles as president of the Fako Lawyers Association, FAKLA. Several international lawyers\u2019 organisations have called for his unconditional release while others have requested the state of Cameroon to try him in a civilian court. ",

The troops, Bakary said had launched raids on Boko Haram strongholds in the Mandara mountains which link the two countries. Tchiroma said the soldiers have also destroyed the residence of a Boko Haram leader which also served as a hideout for the extremists, along with a huge consignment of weapons, vehicles and motorcycles. No soldiers have been killed, he said. He added that more than 20 suspects have also been arrested and are helping the Cameroon and Nigerian militaries in their investigations. He also said troops have destroyed a refuge center for the insurgents in the Mandara highlands, a petroleum depot and an explosives factory, as well as the residence of a Boko Haram leader, which also served as a hideout for the terrorists, and a huge consignment of weapons, vehicles and motorcycles. The more than 5,000 people freed, including elderly persons, have been transported to a camp for displaced people in the Nigerian town of Banki, where they are receiving treatment from both Cameroonian and Nigerian military health workers, he said. Cameroon\u2019s rescue spree of boko haram victims comes a few days after the country has received   from former Nigerian senate president Ameh Ebute for purportedly having links with the boko haram insurgency and encouraging its activities in Nigeria. Senator Ebute had addressed a letter to the UN Security Council calling on the Council to sanction Cameroon and Chad for alleged complacency in the fight against the\u00a0terrorist group. As a reaction, the UN had maintain that it has always counted on the cooperation of all countries in the Lake Chad Basin in the fight against Boko Haram. Boko Haram\u2019s six-year insurgency has killed more than 25,000 people and displaced nearly 2.3 million, according to rights groups and the United Nations",

The Corruption Perceptions Index ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be.

Cameroon Corruption Rank \u2013 actual data, historical chart and calendar of releases \u2013 was last updated on January 2017. No country got close to a perfect score in the Corruption Perceptions Index 2016. Over two-thirds of the 176 countries and territories in this year\u2019s index fall below the midpoint of 0 our scale (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). The global average score is a paltry 43, indicating endemic corruption in a country\u2019s public sector. Top-scoring countries are far outnumbered by orange and red countries where citizens face the tangible impact of corruption on a daily basis. This year\u2019s results highlight the , which feed off each other to create a vicious circle between corruption, unequal distribution of power in society, and unequal distribution of wealth. According to Jos\u00e9 Ugaz, Chair of Transparency International \u201cIn too many countries, people are deprived of their most basic needs and go to bed hungry every night because of corruption, while the powerful and corrupt enjoy lavish lifestyles with impunity.\u201d The interplay of corruption and inequality also feeds populism. When traditional politicians fail to tackle corruption, people grow cynical. Increasingly, people are turning to populist leaders who promise to break the cycle of corruption and privilege. Yet this is likely to exacerbate \u2013 rather than resolve \u2013 the tensions that fed the populist surge in the first place.

    "text": "\u201cOn Monday the 17th of April, 2017, while we, of the Diocese of Mamfe, were celebrating our Priestly Ordinations and basking in our quiet enjoyment in Manyu Division, some people totally unkown to us from Fako Division, namely, Dr. John Lyonga Efande, Ikome Williams Ligange and Alianto Ngala, through their Legal Counsel, Barrister Achu Julius Ngu Tabe,   in Buea, Fako Division and caused the State Counsel of the same Fako to summon the Bishops of Buea, Mamfe and Kumba to appear in Court on Monday the 24th of April, 2017 at 9 am prompt.\u201d the letter reads in part. Going by the Bishop, the seven charges against the Bishops could be summarized in that the Bishops have refused to reopen the Catholic schools and thus supporting the  . \u201cThese people are requesting that the Bishops be convicted and imprisoned and pay damages of 150 billion CFA,\u201d said he. While noting that he will respect the summons which he describes as manipulations by \u201cforces of darkness\u201d the prelate reiterates that he stands by the Communiqu\u00e9 which all the Bishops of the Ecclesiastical Province wrote saying that \u201cWe have never closed schools and our doors remain open\u201d. Below is an excerpt of the letter: As the Bishop of Mamfe, I stand by the Communiqu\u00e9 which all the Bishops of the Ecclesiastical Province wrote saying that \u201cWe have never closed schools and our doors remain open\u201d. The Bishop of Mamfe does not live in Fako, nor does he own schools in Fako and this makes me worried that anybody can sit down in any part of the country and decide that I am a criminal and I have to go to court to prove that I am not. It is all a calculated attempt by some forces of darkness, that we shall get to know sooner than later, to humiliate, intimidate and incriminate the Church and rub the bishops in mud with wanton disregard and disrespect for God, whom these men in spite their human weaknesses, represent. Bishop of Mamfe at a Sermon They may end up discovering that they are fighting against God himself (Acts 5:39). It is the reign of the anti-Christ and this is not new. It is a struggle between light and darkness, it is a battle between good and evil, it is a wrestle between sin and righteousness and a confrontation of truth and lies. This is exactly what happened to my Boss who is the Son of a carpenter, Jesus Christ. He was blackmailed and dragged from Annas the High priest to Caiphas and then finally put before Pontius Pilate who unjustly condemned him to death. Shame to death! On the third day he rose again from the dead \u2013 Alleluia. Now he lives to die no more. Jesus told us to expect this when he said; \u201cIf the world hates you,\u00a0keep in mind that it hated me first.\u00a0\u00a0If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you\u00a0out of the world. That is why the world hates you.\u00a0\u00a0Remember what I told you: \u2018A servant is not greater than his master.\u2019\u00a0If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also.\u00a0If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.\u00a0\u00a0They will treat you this way because of my name,\u00a0for they do not know the one who sent me\u201d(Jn.15:18-21). As a true and law abiding son of this country, I will respect the call of the law of the state and appear before the court of Frist Instance in Buea on Monday, 24th April, 2017 at 9.am prompt. I will not waste Diocesan money, which we don\u2019t have, to hire a lawyer and I will not prepare any defense because I believe in Christ who said: \u201cWatch out! Men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their synagogues.\u00a0You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to those who aren\u2019t Jews.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut when they arrest you, don\u2019t worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time you will be given the right words to say.\u00a0It will not be you speaking. The Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you.\u201d(Mtt.10:17-20). I therefore call on all Christians of Mamfe to do the following: Stay calm and restrain from any acts of violence, be it verbal, physical or even psychological, that will only make the situation worse. This is a call I made to all the Motor Bike Riders on the 31st of December, 2016 and to all the Youth of the Diocese during the World Youth Day on the 9th of April, 2017 and I am repeating to all Christians of Mamfe today. From the 22nd of April 2017, which is the 25th Anniversary of my ordination to the Sacred Priesthood, the prayer to St. Michael the Archangel shall be recited at the end of each Mass before the final blessing, immediately after the prayer for the Diocese of Mamfe. This prayer will go on in all the churches of Mamfe Diocese as long as the case goes on. The intention is for the conversion of the claimants and their sponsors, the good conscience and fear of God in the judges, for our entire country and for the strength of the Bishop of Mamfe. Christians from the Diocese of Mamfe and Friends of the Diocese who wish to witness this trial are free to come to Buea on this stipulated day and time and join in this \u201cGethsemane\u201d experience which your chief pastors have been subjected to. Mamfe Diocese has always been One Family and I pray all the people of the Diocese to remain united at this time of difficulty. Remember that if there is no cross, then our Christianity is empty and there will be no resurrection. I wish all of you once again a very happy Easter and abundance of God\u2019s blessing. Given in Galilee, Israel, this Friday, 21st April, 2017.",

    "text": "The on-going sit-in strike of Common Law lawyers has taken a new twist with the counsel of some of the detained protesters, exchanging unkind words with the leaders of the Bar Council in the press. Jackson Francis Ngnie Kamnga, President of the Cameroon Bar Council   week that the striking lawyers of the Anglophone regions (North West and South West) will resume work on May 2. In reaction, Barrister Benard Muna, former President of the Bar Council held a press conference discrediting the current president (Batonnier). Muna is leading a group of over 100 lawyers defending their colleagues and other activists arrested in relation to the lawyers\u2019 strike which merged with that of teachers and engulfed the entire population of the Anglophone region who felt touched by their concerns. Batonnier Kamnga, said in his announcement that he met with a conclave of \u201cSenior\u201d barristers in the North West and South West regions who gave him the impression that government had met \u201call\u201d the demands of Common Law lawyers. He said the lawyers assured him they would resume work and that he was going to ensure the release of two lawyers detained for being part of or leading the strike. He also said he was going to continue dialogue with government to ensure the promises made by the minister of justice are kept. Other lawyers; some on the run and others at home,   the bar council president for opting to negotiate with government on behalf of common law lawyers. They argue Anglophone lawyers have four associations with leaders who could speak on their behalf. The Bar President, had stated in his release that it was the conclave of lawyers that asked him to dialogue on behalf of common law lawyers. Barrister Benard Muna, April 13, signed a statement on behalf of the defence lawyers of detained activists. He announced that the defence lawyers, \u201cdistance themselves from the steps taken by the President of the Bar Council within the framework of the unrepresentative entity styled the \u201cCONCLAVE\u201d as outlined in a press release issued by him on April 9 without prior consultations with the detainees and the Team of Defence Lawyers.\u201d The release also stated that \u201cneither they (lawyers) nor the detained persons whom they defend are bound by any promise given or commitment made by the Bar Council President.\u201d Barrister Muna\u2019s press statement also criticised the Batonnier for not requesting in his April 9 release, that detained lawyers and all other detained persons should be freed. Batonnier Kamga was also faulted for failing to say anything about lawyers on exile or those whose movements in the country have been restricted. In a strongly worded statement written on the behest of the Batonnier, the Secretary General of Bar Council pointed out that the April 9 communique had nothing to do with Ben Muna and his group of lawyers. He said the duty of the Bar President is to protect lawyers; noting that other activists facing trial at the military tribunal in Yaounde who are not lawyers, such as Mancho Bibixy, Dr. Fontem Neba and others, cannot benefit from the cover of the bar. The release issued yesterday April 19, equally points out that the Bar Council President has the right to defend Barristers, Felix Agbor Kongho and Walters Abadem in court and the right to create a conclave with which to discuss and make decisions. \u201cAny press release that tends to disregard or challenge the powers of the Bar Council and the President of the Bar, whatever it may be, constitutes a breach of the provisions of the Law of the organisation and the standing orders of the Bar and should be considered as such, that is, deemed unwritten. The current controversy further cast doubts on the possibility of common law lawyers resuming work on May 2. The detained leaders of the Consortium which has been coordinating the ongoing strike in Anglophone regions, according to Barrister Ben Muna, have promised to ensure live in the regions return to normal, if they are released alongside all citizens detained for alleged involvement in ",

The lawyer and other leaders of the Consortium are charged with terrorism, unlawful assembly, rebellion, revolution, and other offences.

    "text": "The government of Cameroon has decided to restore internet connectivity in the English-speaking regions. The regions have been deprived of internet for more than three months. A press release of Issa Tchiroma Bakary, Communication Minister, made public this April 20, says the Head of State has authorised the telecom minister to order telecom companies to resume provision of internet access to their customers. The minister\u2019s communique said social media users will be monitored, in a bid to avoid propagation of hate speech, which according to government, was the reason the region was deprived of the modern communication technology. The release which was read over state radio, recalled scenes of destruction of public and private property during the on-going protests in the North West and South West region. The minister said school children were intimidated by \u201cextremists\u201d and\u201dseparatists\u201d instigated through the social media. Government said the \u201cextremists\u201d and \u201cenemies of the state\u201d used the social media to take advantage of the on-going protest in the region to push their secessionist agenda. The release says President Paul Biya has instructed the Post and Telecommunication minster to order the companies to restore internet after taking required measures to solve the problems of striking teachers and lawyers. Tchiroma also says Cameroonians and the international community applauded the decisions taken by ministers following directives from the President, to solve the crisis. It should be recalled that the internet was shut down on January 17 shortly after the arrest of leaders of the Anglophone Civil Society Consortium, Barrister Felix Agbor \u2018Balla Kongho, and Dr Fontem Neba. Since there several national and international organisation have been calling on government to reinstate internet connection.",

    "text": "Harmony Bobga Mbuton, president of Cameroon\u2019s North West Lawyers Association, returned to   on Al Jazeera this week, just over two months since the show originally explored the protests among his country\u2019s English-speaking communities, who claim French-speaking President Paul Biya\u2019s government is treating them as second-class citizens.  host Femi Oke says that, since that show, \u201cThe government of Cameroon has   and banned public gatherings in the regions fraught with tensions. What started as strikes for bilingualism in the Northwest and Southwest territories have revealed very deep political divides that spread beyond language, culture and geography.\u201d On   in December, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, the Minister of Communications, promised negotiations but Mbuton says these broke down quickly. \u201cIn fact, I was part of the negotiations that ensued and took place in Yaounde on 27-28 December 2016. The government had constructed the questions that had to be dealt with in the negotiation to suit their own purpose. We walked out of the dialogue and the next thing we heard was that they started  which is what forced me to flee from Cameroon, through Nigeria to here [Washington DC] now.\u201d Mbuton\u2019s wife and children are still in Cameroon, where he says, \u201cThe situation is bad,\u201d comparing it to \u201cwhat happened in Rwanda when the genocide began.\u201d He claims that people are being arrested and taken away, with their families unable to find out where. \u201cIt is tipping into the point where the population is saying that even with their empty hands and sticks, they are ready to start providing resistance to protect themselves.\u201d The media and internet blackout makes it difficult to verify claims like this; as Mbuton says, the internet ban has meant \u201cthat the government has operated behind the curtains because there is no easy access to information within the territory anymore.\u201d Mbuton says people are using smartphones to send images and information out to the world by traveling to the French-speaking parts of Cameroon where there is still internet, \u201cbut it\u2019s not flowing as it was.\u201c Since the protests began nearly four months ago, Biya has signed a decree establishing a national commission to promote bilingualism and has addressed protesters several times in major speeches. At least several hundred protesters have been arrested. Some are being tried for terrorism for allegedly calling for secession of the Anglophone regions. They could face the death penalty if convicted. Mbuton says the strike is ongoing and international protests are increasing. Even Cameroon\u2019s recent victory at the African Cup of Nations was not enough to unite the country. \u201cThe provocative move to go and show off the African Cup that was won by Cameroon was welcomed by ghost towns,\u201d says Mbuton. \u201cPeople abandoned the streets. Only the entourage from Yaounde was parading the streets \u2013 in military vehicles.\u201d",

Reports by the French language daily   say there were arrested Thursday February 9, after a morning mass and taken to an unknown destination. The informant who spoke to Le Messager said no one is aware of the whereabouts of those arrested. The source said that there are indications that schools will not resume soon. This he said, is owed, partly to the fact that security forces are everywhere looking for people to arrest. The source said tens of people were arrested when a group of visibly angry citizens tried to block security forces from arresting a school principal whose school had been partly burnt down. Other sources say the clashes between security forces and the people of Jakiri resulted in the death of one citizen. Several other people are said to have been injured in the confrontations. Two days after the incident in Bui division of the North West region, similar   Ngohkentunji division where at least two people were killed. Just like the clashes in Jakiri, the incident in Ndop was related to the on-going crisis rocking the North West and South West regions of Cameroon. Meanwhile, in Bambili, a few kilometers from Ndop, Akume Daniel Akume, Director of the Higher Technical Teachers\u2019 Training College (HTTC) of the University of Bamenda, issued an ultimatum for students to return to school by February 15. Despite the fact that classes had been paralyzes since November 21, 2016, the college director informed students that the first semester examination for levels 300 and 500 were scheduled to run from February 15 to 20 beginning each day at 7am. Adolphe Lele L\u2019Afrique, Goverrnor of the region, for his part, equally stated categorically that schools must resume in the region regardless of the on-going protests, characterized by ghost towns and threats on citizens who defy calls for  . The leaders of the on-going protest which is evidently no longer a teachers and lawyers strike, insist any dialogue with government should have only one thing on the agenda- the organization of a referendum that would possibly restore the federal system of government that existed in the country at the wake of reunification of West and East Cameroon.",

I join the Cameroon American Council in calling for an end to these sorts of fear tactics, which have no place in modern society. \u201cRespect for basic human rights is a key tenet of any democratic society and one which all countries must strive to achieve. It is critical that the government of Cameroon recognize and protect the rights of every citizen, regardless of background. \u201cI strongly urge the government to end violent attacks on protesters, ease media restrictions, eliminate judicial irregularities in the court system, and lift the internet blackout that has now been in place for 60 days in majority English-speaking regions. In a similar tier, Congressman Andre Carson, has equally exhorted President Biya to ease tension before the situation degrades further. Hear him; \u201cAs the outgoing co-chair of the Congressional Cameroon Caucus, I have been deeply disturbed by the recent reports that protests over perceived marginalization of Cameroon\u2019s Anglophone population have resulted in a harsh government crackdown. Reports indicate that numerous protestors have been detained and today marks the 60th day of an internet blackout that is causing a major setback for the social and economic future of a previously economically vibrant region. Andre Carson \u00a9All rights reserved \u201cThis suppression is particularly concerning given our foreign aid for the people of Cameroon and our shared mission to encourage economic development, stability, and democracy in the region. Just this week, the Cameroonian military freed 5,000 prisoners held by Boko Haram, highlighting the government\u2019s laudable commitment to counterterrorism. Yet, as with all of our friends, we have an obligation to hold the Cameroonian government accountable when their actions suppress free expression and fail to protect minority populations. I call on President Biya and the government of Cameroon to ease tensions before the situation degrades further.\u201d",

Joseph Wirba, outspoken SDF MP for Jakari Special Constituency who is currently on self-exile in the United States. The SDF parliamentary group leader made the revelation to press five days after tough-talking Wirba sneaked out of the country into Nigeria and later travelled to the US. Banadzem told press yesterday that he has a copy of the arrest warrant the fugitive parliamentarian sent to him. He also revealed that they had asked the Right Honourable Cavaye Yeguie Djirbil, Speaker of the National Assembly to protect Wirba, without which he will not step foot in the house of assembly. Hon Banadzem also decried the fact that the police chief issued a warrant of arrest for a sitting Member of Parliament who is supposed to have parliamentary immunity. The March session of parliament opened on Monday March 13 at a time when political analysts were casting doubts over the fate of outspoken SDF Member of Parliament. He was absent from the opening and later confirmed his escape in a Facebook post. It should be recalled that the Jakiri MP boosted his popularity among English-speaking Cameroonians when he mounted the pedestal in the National Assembly in November 2016 and pleaded their case. It should be noted that the SDF MP is more or less seen as one of the motivators of the on-going protests in the North West and South West regions of Cameroon. Almost every influential English speaking Cameroonian who has, in the past couple of months, been vocal about the Anglophone problem has either been arrested or is in hiding. Hon. Wirba, it should be recalled, told the House Speaker that his observations of the marginalisation of Anglophones have made him to conclude that Southern Cameroons secessionists are right in their struggle.",

The family in press statement said Ayah\u2019s cardiologist is not allowed to visit him for medical examinations. The family statement said the detained Supreme Court judge suffered a second malaise in his cell on February 17, apparently due to the inadequate circulation of air in his tight and poorly ventilated jail cell. The family however acknowledged that some government officials who learned of the detainee\u2019s situation, promised to call the attention of competent authorities who would ensure he is escorted to hospital where his cardiologists would carry out all necessary examinations. Ayah\u2019s doctor, the statement said, had since January 25, advised that he should be brought to the hospital for immediate check-up. His health is said to have been deteriorating by the day since his arrest in mid-January. Though Ayah was arrested from home over one month ago in \u201ctotal violation of legal, moral and common sense procedures\u201d as the family puts it, he is yet to be charged. Reports say he has also resisted attempts from gendarmerie officers to chisel out a statement from him. He is said to have stood his grounds, saying he would only speak before a competent commission that meets the legal requirements for the grilling of a sitting Supreme Court Magistrate. Government is yet to issue an official statement regarding his arrest. Meanwhile Ayah was conspicuously absent at the opening of the judicial year at the Supreme Court in Yaounde February 22. The 2017 judicial year follows a turbulent judicial year characterised by a three month sit-down strike by lawyers of the Common Law extraction. The lawyers who are still on strike and some of whom are in detention, are requesting the creation of a department in the Supreme Court for the hearing of Common Law cases. Besides the creation of the department which will work side by side the Civil Law department, the lawyers were also demanding the creation of a Common Law department in the National School of Administration and Magistracy, ENAM, the redeployment of Civil Law Magistrates to Civil Law zones (Francophone Cameroon) and Common Law Magistrates to Common Law zones (Anglophone Cameroon). Observers say the arrest of Ayah Paul Abine who doubles as Chairman of the People\u2019s Action Party is linked to the  of English-speaking Cameroonians. They have been protesting against what they describe as a second class citizenship status which they have been burdened with for over 56 years.",

    "text": "The agreement, signed in Yaounde on March 2 protects the rights of more than 85, 000 Nigerians who fled Boko Haram terrorism and found refuge in Cameroon. It was signed by Rene Emmanuel Sadi, Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation on behalf of Cameroon, Lt. General Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau, Nigeria\u2019s Interior Minister and Kouassi Lazare Etien, UNHCR representative in Cameroon. It sets down the conditions for repatriation of Nigerian refugees living in Cameroon, with emphasis on the respect for international humanitarian law. Kouassi thanked the governments of both countries on behalf of Filippo Grandi, UNHCR High Commissioner for the deliberations that led to the drafting of the agreement. He told observers at the signing ceremony that included government officials from Nigeria and Cameroon as well as representatives of diplomatic missions accredited to Cameroon, that the agreement requires both countries to ensure that all refugees conserve the right to decide whether or not they want to return to Nigeria. They also have the right to choose the time of return without any political or administrative pressure. The agreement, according to the UNHCR representative, protects refugees\u2019 right to asylum- a right which he stressed, is necessary for the preservation of people\u2019s lives, physical integrity and liberties. \u201cThe signing of this agreement does not mean that all Nigerian refugees must return to their country because some of them expressed the willingness to do so\u201d. To ensure that the rights of refugees are respected, the agreement has provisions for investigations into cases of individuals returning to Nigeria. The investigations would be made to ascertain whether the refugee\u2019s decision to return was taken freely and voluntarily. Nigerians who, for one reason or the other, feel that they are not ready to return, will have the right to retain their refugee status and benefit from the protection of Cameroonian authorities. The UNHCR would, according to the agreement, provide Nigerian refugees with up-to-date information at all times to enable them take the right decisions with regards to returning to their country of origin. Signatories of tripartite agreement (c)All rights reserved Rene E Sadi, Cameroon\u2019s territorial administration minister said the signing of the agreement is an indication that the war against Boko Haram is almost over. He however expressed concerns about poverty and underdevelopment in some of the refugees and IDPs\u2019 localities of origin. \u201cTogether we are winning the war against Boko Haram and I hope that together we will win the battle against poverty and underdevelopment. Minister Sadi, promised that \u201cThe government of Cameroon will continue to ensure the protection of Nigerian refugees on its territory and will spare no effort to help those who wish to return to Nigeria, with accordance with international agreements\u201d. He also stressed the need for development in the frontiers between Cameroon and Nigeria, noting that the borders are notorious for all sorts of trafficking and insecurity. Retired Lt. Gen Bello Dambazau, said the agreement highlights the importance of working together. \u201cThe agreement is a feat in fulfilling the decisions taken by Presidents Muhammad Buhari and Paul Biya (of Nigeria and Cameroon, respectively). It is a demonstration of African unity; demonstration of regional solidarity and we greatly appreciate the hospitality of the Cameroonian government and people.\u201d The Nigerian Interior Minister said his country\u2019s acting president asked him to express his gratitude to Cameroon and the UNHCR. \u201cThe agreement is a beginning of a process that will culminate in the resettlement of the refugees. The governor of Borno state and the speaker of the Borno state house of assembly were part of the Nigerian delegation to Cameroon. Most of the Nigerian refugees in and out of the Minawao camp in Cameroon\u2019s Far North region are from Borno state. Lt. Gen. Bello said many hospitals, schools and other infrastructure in Borno state were destroyed by Boko Haram. A study the UNHCR carried out between April and September 2016 revealed that 71 percent of Nigerian refugees in the Minawao Camp would like to go back to their country whenever it is conducive. Many of those who are unwilling to return, according to the study, come from localities that lack basic social amenities.",

A parking space immediately gaped out of a crowd of lawyers, pressmen, military officers and family members of detainees,. The minus drove into the space, followed by a military pick-up truck that escorted it. Soldiers wearing ski masks sat inside and at the back of the truck, heavily armed. Barrister Felix Agbor \u2018Balla\u2019 Kongho smiled and raised a clenched fist (the Power Fist repesenting unity, resistance, defiance and solidarity) at onlookers as soon as the door of the minibus was pulled opened. Two daughters and two sons of his looked on from the crowd. He chatted for a few seconds with another occupant at the back of the bus before stepping out. When he stepped out, Mancho Bibixy, another influential activist arrested and accused of the same  , followed. Rowdiness suddenly embraced the courtyard as both suspects struggled to make their way into the court room. Security officers stretched their arms as they tried to create a human fence on both sides of the path of the activists. Some of them did so in bid to block lawyers from shaking hands with their detained colleague. Others struggled to block pressmen from taking pictures or talking to the activists. \u201cOnly the state media is allowed to film\u201d they said. Some of the lawyers however managed to shake hands with Barrister Agbor \u2018Balla\u2019 while others tapped Mancho BBC on the back. Mancho Bibixy, dressed in the North West regalia which has been repeatedly worn by Cameroonian delegations to the several editions of the Olympic games, kept singing as he walked in. \u201cHome again; home again; when shall I see my home? When shall I see my native land? I will never forget my home;\u201d he sang as he walked into the courtroom. A few minutes after the arrival of the duo from the Secretariat of State for defence, SED, a prison truck drove in. Out of it came about 25 detainees from the Yaounde Central Prison in the Kondengui neighbourhood. The suspects, some of whom were arrested since December last year, were all handcuffed. Some of them won\u2019t look at the crowd while those who did had teary eyes. Family members looked on helplessly. Noella, who stood outside the courtroom with her father, told Journal du Cameroun she has not seen her brother, Tata Elvis for months, since he and his friend Stephen were arrested at Mile 4 Bamenda and transferred to Yaounde overnight. \u201cI was not in court last time. I have just seen him walked in. He saw us standing here\u201d she said, trying to hold back tears. Our mother has also not seen him for months. We all hope this will be over and we will have him home. At about midday, the court was yet to begin the hearing. We learned Dr. Fontem Neba of the University of Buea lecturers\u2019 syndicate was yet to be brought to the court. One of the over 100 lawyers defending the activists told Journal du Cameroun, that the trial may not begin until all the suspects of the Anglophone crisis, programed for hearing today are present. All the detainees arrested in relation to the   in the North West and South West region face accusations related to terrorism alongside additional charges such as rebellion, contempt of state officials, lack of ID cards etc. A few activists from the Human Rights Defenders Network in Central Africa, REDHAC could be seen distributing bandannas to sympathisers at the courtyard.

Their demands centred on greater inclusion and promotion of English-speaking Cameroonians in the teaching and legal sectors as well as across government and society in general, both regionally and nationally. The strikes were followed a few weeks later, by public protests in the regions two main centres, Bamenda and Buea. The strikes were organised by civil society organisations in the regions in support of the teacher and lawyer strikes and; against the general   of Anglophone Cameroonians by the Francophone authorities and government of President Paul Biya. The protests were broadened to include   actions \u2013 stay-at-home boycotts enacted twice a week that led to major disruptions of schooling, judicial processes, businesses and other essential services. The government responded to protests with a security crackdown that led to reported human rights violations by the security forces including killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, torture, harassment and intimidation. The Internet blockade instituted in January has denied millions of people in the Anglophone regions access to the Internet and currently remains in effect. This virtual blockade and the militarised security crackdown in the South West and North West regions, has produced a pervasive climate of repression, fear and intimidation amongst English speaking Cameroonians Concerned about the worsening human rights situation, a four-person delegation from   embarked on a fact-finding mission to Cameroon from 15  to 20  February 2017; to understand the nature of the conflict, its context and its impact on the people of Cameroon and; to help seek peaceful and just solutions to the crisis for the Cameroonian people. The delegation met discreetly with a range of stakeholders, many of whom requested anonymity out of fear for their safety. They shared eyewitness accounts of the reported human rights violations and their impacts on local communities. The delegation directly observed the devastating economic impact of   disrupted cellular communications, the closure of businesses and, the negative social impacts on education, healthcare and, general security in the regions affected by the government\u2019s militarised security crackdown. We can say with no exaggeration that the South West and North West regions of Cameroon are in crisis. The repressive response by government has also had a serious political impact, most notably the closing of civic space for political action that in turn undermines citizens\u2019 fundamental rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association. This deepening crisis, has the potential to flare up into another genocide \u2013   recommends that: The government end the repressive actions and fear by ceasing its militarised security operations in the Anglophone regions with immediate effect; the immediate and unconditional release all people detained \u2013 including children, civil society leaders and, journalists \u2013 arrested and detained in connection with the process; the immediate   and, the resumption of schooling; Urgently proceed with the establishment of an open, independently mediated dialogue process between government, the Anglophone people and civil society to address all grievances and heal this disunity of the Cameroonian peoples. As an emerging movement of people and social formations, working for justice, peace and dignity we call on African organisations such as the African Union and, social justice groupings; to engage and help bring about lasting peace and build solidarity with the people of Cameroon for a peaceful and prosperous future for all.",

He however noted that the dialogue which he says is on-going, is guided by the constitution of the Cameroon republic. It should however be recalled that the outlawed Anglophone Civil Society Consortium which is coordinating the protests in the English Speaking regions otherwise known as Southern Cameroons or West Cameroons, share a different school of thought. In release issued last week, in which the Consortium acknowledged the presidency had   to them for dialogue, the current leaders of the protests noted that they informed President Biya\u2019s envoy that from their observation Cameroonians from the North West and South West region prefer secession. But insisted the consortium is requesting the return to a two-state federation as obtained in 1961 during the unification of West and East Cameroons. Apart from the protest affecting the education, the judiciary system and businesses in Anglophone regions, President Biya also talked about Boko Haram insurgency. He equally raise concerns climate change sustainable\u00a0development, and growing illegal immigration issues. Conspicuously absent in the president\u2019s suite to Italy was Martin Belinga Eboutou, Director of Cabinet at the Presidency. The director of cabinet who always travels out of the country every time the president is on official and private trips abroad was replaced on the trip to Italy by his assistant, Joseph Anderson Le. Sources say Belinga was absent\u00a0due to ill-health. The 77-year old who has been Cameroonian ambassador to several countries, was equally absent during this year\u2019s New Year wishes ceremony at the presidency for health reasons.

Abba, who has been in jail since July 2015 over his reporting, could have faced the death penalty on the charges. Since his arrest, Abba has denied the charges, brought against him under an anti-terrorism law passed the year before. Judge Edou Mewoutou also ordered him to pay a fine of 55 million F CFA and barred him from speaking to the media about the trial. Clement Nakong, Abba\u2019s lawyer has said he would appeal the sentence. Abba, who reported for RFI\u2019s Hausa language service from Cameroon\u2019s restive north, was arrested in the Maroua region in the far north, in July 2015, on suspicion of having collaborated with militant Islamist group and withholding information in connection with his coverage of attacks by the terrorist group from Cameroonian authorities. Facing the death penalty over the alleged crimes, Abba says he was held and tortured by Cameroonian intelligence services for a period of three months before he was transferred to the prison in Yaound\u00e9. Cameroon introduced capital punishment for involvement in terror attacks or complicity in terrorism in a controversial law passed in 2014. Since his arrest, several rights groups including the Committee to Protect Journalists have condemned the act stating that covering terrorism as a reporter must not be equated with committing acts of terror.

Justice Ab\u00e9ga, announced the joinder of proceedings on Friday in favour of a request put forward by the state prosecutor on Mach 23. The request had been rejected by the counsel of the detainees. They had argued the two cases had\u00a0insufficient connection to qualify for a joinder. The \u2018commissaire au gouvernement\u2019 for his part had attempted to justify his request by referring to Article 6 of the Criminal Procedural Code. The article provides that the joinder of procedures is compulsory in cases of indivisibility and optional in cases of connectivity. Indivisibility is said to exist in a case involving many suspects or accomplices in the same offense;\u00a0where there is a close relationship between several offenses committed by the same person, one cannot be judged without the other and when offenses committed at the same time have the same purpose. Connectivity, on the other hand, is when the offenses were committed at the same time by several persons acting together; when offenses have been committed by different persons, even at different times and places, but as a result of a conspiracy;\u00a0When an offense has been committed, either to facilitate the commission of another, or to ensure the impunity of the latter. \u201d The 24 young people were arrested in Bamenda, Buea, Tiko and Kumba.\u00a0They are   for hostility against their homeland, contempt of state officials, rebellion, and degradation of public property, gang robbery and co-action in acts of terrorism. The decision rendered by the judge on Friday has been criticised by the defense.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a complication for the defence because now defendants have been increased to 27, whereas we had only three in the file.

Observers are questioning why only Randy\u2019s equipment were seized whereas there were over a dozen journalists covering the event without any special passes. Randy has been reporting extensively on the Anglophone protests that have registered several deaths. The leaders of the strike by Anglophone lawyers and teachers have been arrested and charged with treason and incitement to rebellion against the State etc. The crackdown on   leaders and civil society activists has sent others fleeing. Firebrand Southern Cameroons nationalist, Barrister Harmony Bobga Mbutton has resurfaced in the US. His colleagues such as Barristers Sang George Ndang secretary general of the North West Lawyers Association have also disappeared. The arrests have not spared Supreme Court Justice Paul Ayah Abine who has been very vocal about the second class status of English speakers in Cameroon. He too has been charged for treason. Tim Finnian, a journalist and publisher of   newspaper has also been arrested and detained at the national gendarmerie headquarters in Yaound\u00e9.

Political analysts however hold the UN position on the crisis is not strange. They stated that the UN is known for always sending its 2peacekeepers\u201d to act when it is already a full crisis situation.

It should be recalled that Barrister Muna who is under investigation had issued a strongly worded statement after the summons, noting that he will not flee from Cameroon as some well-wishers were suggesting he should. Below is the statement, he released, reaffirming his decision to abid by the law and honour the summons: I have been flooded by calls and messages from many Cameroonians who seemed worried for my safety. I hereby state the facts, as I know them, to avoid any unfounded rumors. On Monday 20th March 2017 at around 15.00 hrs a bailiff dropped at the Muna Foundation, a letter addressed to the President of the Bar Council Batonnier Jackson Ngnie Kamga .

In the letter, Batonnier was asked to accompany at 9.00 to the central investigation department on Wednesday March 2017.

I immediately wrote to the Secretary of State informing him that I was delivering a keynote address in Johannesburg on Wednesday March 22nd and that I will be back on Thursday and will ask the Batonnier to accompany me on Friday March 25 th. Today March 21st I boarded a Rwandair Flight 10.05 from Douala and left for Johannesburg. I will defer to the summons and be present on Friday. I understand the worry of many well-wishers who are asking me to stay away. Cameroon is my home and I am prepared to face whatever awaits me. Any lawyer who is worth anything cannot sit by in the face of suffering and blatant violation of the basic and fundamental rights of any other human being. By remaining sheep for too long, I am afraid we have turned some people in our government into emboldened wolves. The comfort of my home and my office cannot justify my silence in the face of what we are going through in our country right now. Come what may. Akere T.

The shutdown has caused Cameroon over $1.39million, as at February, to go by Access Now. Going by the policy proposal, countries which tamper with the internet would at the end of such shut down not be allocated an IP address for one year. We gathered the suggested sanction extends to the transfer of addresses to government-owned structures within the one year period. In case any African government cuts the internet three or more times within ten years, AFRINIC proposal suggests that all services provided to such countries be revoked, with no allocations offered for a period of five years. The proposal was co-authored and submitted to AFRINIC by Ben Roberts, CEO of Liquid Telecom Kenya, Andrew Alston, Liquid\u2019s group head of IP strategy, and Fiona Asonga, CEO of the Telecommunications Service Providers\u2019 Association of Kenya. AFRINIC notes on its website that \u201cover the last few years, we have seen more and more governments shutting down the free and open access to the internet in order to push political and other agendas. These shutdowns have been shown to cause economic damage and hurt the citizens of the affected countries. \u201cWhile the authors of this policy acknowledge that what is proposed is draconian in nature, we feel that the time has come for action to be taken, rather than just bland statements that have shown to have little or no effect.\u201d According to Ben Roberts, Africa just can\u2019t sustain internet outages of any kind since its experiencing a technology revolution driven by the internet. If the proposal passes, Roberts told a US based news organ that \u201cgovernments may think twice\u201d before shutting down the internet and will start thinking of the internet as \u201can essential service just like water and electricity.\u201d Lately, internet shutdowns have become rampant across Africa, with 11 cases recorded last year. Cameroon now stands out as the country with the longest internet shutdown in Africa, a phenomenon which has attracted unwanted global attention to Biya\u2019s 33 year old regime.",

    "text": "The original jail term was slammed by the Special Criminal Court, SCC, on August 12, 2013. The former public health minister was accused of embezzlement of circa 80million FCFA allocated for the purchase of mosquito nets for an anti-malaria campaign. According to the Committee for the Liberation of Political Prisoners, the charges against the minister were made up to cover a political motive of the government. Going by the Committee, the sum of money the minister was accused of embezzling, was entirely received by a certain Yves Soue Mbella through the Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance. Mbella, the committee wrote in a press release issued today April 4, had admitted to have received the money. The committee also claims in the release that the Ministry of Public Health never requested transfer of funds from the treasury department to Mbella\u2019s company, Vision SARL which was supposed to deliver the mosquito nets. The release says the payment was not ordered because the company did not supply the requested mosquito nets. Mbella, the CL2P says, sued the minister, whereas he had received money for goods he did not deliver to the public health ministry\u2019s national program for the fight against malaria. The committee also claims the Vison SARL boss is being protected by some top government officials, suggesting they are the ones using him to victimise the imprisoned former state official. The pressure group describes the confirmation of Olanguena\u2019s sentence by the Supreme Court as unjust and scandalous. The decision, according to CL2P, attributes to Olanguena Awono a punishment per \u201cerroneous plaintiff who appears to have benefited from the protection of certain hidden forces at the top of the State of Cameroon.\u201d The committee which also defends the rights of other so-called political prisoners in Cameroon, links former minister Olanguena\u2019s condemnation to reports that some ministers were planning to overthrow President Paul Biya who has been in power since 1982. Accusing Cameroon for jailing the innocent and ignoring fugitives, the rights organisation also states categorically in today\u2019s release that \u201chis legal troubles originate from the Cameroon secret service notes which made him a member of the G11; a group of young state officials suspected of advocating the alternation to power in 2011\u201d. The committee also reiterates its stance that Olanguena Awono who has been jail since he was arrested on March 31, 2008, is a political prisoner and calls for his immediate release.",

Muna told reporters in Yaounde that the lawyers say they have found ample evidence that a genocide is being committed in the North West and South West regions where protesters have   and court rooms. The proofs of genocide, he said, will be presented either to the International Criminal Court, ICC, the United Nations, UN, or the International Criminal Court of Justice, ICJ for perpetrators of such crimes to be brought to book. Barrister Muna, who is a former president of the Cameroon Bar Council, disclosed that he provided some of the evidence the lawyers examined.

He said a genocide may include infringement on the way of life of a people by killing the members of the group, causing serious mental harm to the members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group\u2019s conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the whole or part of the group. \u201cCollective punishment such as internet shutdown is prohibited by the 1949 Geneva Convention\u201d he said.",

One of the four trade union leaders who signed the decision to call off the strike; the four who are accused of each collecting 150million FCFA bribe from government. \u201cWe did not collect 150million from government. I signed the document under duress. Can you imagine we held 11 meetings in about five days? The governor kept calling us to his office and insisting we should sign the document and call off the strike. He said if we refused, we would be held responsible for calling on people to  the February 11 celebrations.\u201d He told us in a phone interview. Tammeh also revealed that the governor went as far as attempting to bring the communique to his house for him to sign it. \u201cI pleaded he should not come and traumatise my children. I went to him and he kept telling me in a calm voice to sign the document. I told him we started working on this document with Tassang Wilfred and held several meetings in the North West and South West. I told him solidarity requires that all of us (six trade union leaders) who organised the strike should be present to call it off.\u201d He revealed. Tammeh who said he was not in hiding and gave to understanding that he now fears for his life, said he told Governor Adolphe Lele Lafrique it was signing the communique was not the right thing for him to do. \u201cI only signed because of pressure\u201d he said, but added that he is happy they called the strike off because \u201cit has proven that the strike was no longer a teachers\u2019 thing.\u201d Tammeh noted that people on the West of the Mungo are calling him a traitor, but said he knows God will know he did not betray anyone, if it happens that he dies because of the on-going movement. \u201cMy wish is that the crisis should be over and let those who are in hiding and in prison regain their places in our society. When we started this strike, our prayer was that not a single citizen be killed. But many people have been killed and imprisoned.\u201d Said he. He also regretted the fact that English-speaking Cameroonians disgruntled by prolonged marginalisation, used the teacher\u2019s strike to express their despair.\u201dwas not really our place to ask for a return to federation. Demanding solutions to education issues would have had short term ramifications. The call for a return to federation would have long term ramifications. Right now I am in school, Government Bilingual High School, Bamenda and there are no students. Nothing is happening here.\u201d Stephen Afuh, President of the Presbyterian Education Authority Teachers Trade Union; PEATTU who, reports say has been disavowed by the Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon for signing the communique, corroborated Tammeh\u2019s declaration that they were under duress. He confirmed that they were threatened they would be held responsible if the 11  February celebration is boycotted in the NW and SW as the Consortium is advocating. \u201cWe were also under preasure from teachers in the private sector who have not been receiving salaries. It is their only source of income and school proprietors have not been paying them on grounds that school fees are not being paid.\u201d he said. Afuh, also noted that he had been against the addition to education-related demands, the request for a return to federalism. \u201cWe are not signatories to The Consortium. \u201cI told Tassang Wilfred to let us solve our education problems and let the federation issue be handled on a different platform\u201d.

This was shortly after the communique which was also signed by Ayeah Emmanuela on behalf of Baptist school teachers, was made public. The Catholics, Presbyterians and universities of Bamenda and Buea have also refused to reopen their schools. Meanwhile, in the communique  the strike, the teachers stated that they reserve the right to lift the suspension of the strike anytime they are convinced that government is not fulfilling nor honouring the pledge made in the Ad Hoc resolutions and recommendations.",

    "text": "President Biya and his wife Chantal Biya are guests of honour at the Vatican today. The presidential couple are expected to meet the pope at the headquarters of the Catholic Church. President Biya is in Italy on a three-day official visit which started on Monday March 20. He was invited by Italian President who was in Cameroon last year. It is expected that the President would discuss with the clergy, regarded by Catholics as God\u2019s representative on earth, the crisis in English-speaking regions of Cameroon- crisis which Catholic Bishops have expressed their availability to be mediators in government- civil society negotiations that may bring it to an end. The bishops, grouped under the Bamenda Ecclesiastical Province, before signing a communique in which they notified government of their availability, had earlier sent a strongly worded memo to President Biya, pointing out that some of the problems raised by protesters in the minority Anglophone regions of the country were real and needed to be solved as soon as possible. Government for its part, a few months later, blamed the Catholic Church and other denominational schools for keeping their doors shut; a move which observers saw as an indirect accusation that the churches were supporting or sympathising with protesters. This prompted the Catholic Church to sign a joint press release with officials of other denominational schools, informing the public that the doors of their schools have always been open all through the strike which will soon enter its 6  month. Since the announcement, parents have however kept their children at home. While government says children are staying at home because they are scared of being attacked by some extremist protesters who may attack them in school, other analysts argue parents would only send their children to school when government solves the issues raised by protesters. It should be noted however that the protests which started late last year as industrial protests by teachers and lawyers is now coordinated by the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Organisation. The civil society organisation was formed when many other civil society organisations and activists in the North West and South West regions joined the strike and turned it into a regional protest against inequalities in political representation and wealth distribution. Though the pressure group was banned in January this year, it still coordinates the strike through interim leaders based abroad. Some of the initial leaders will appear before the military tribunal in Yaounde today to answer terrorism and rebellion charges while others are on the run.    ",

Concerning the   of marginalisation of the Common Law, the minister said President Biya has given high instructions for a common law section to be created in the National School of Administration and Magistracy,ENAM.

A special recruitment of english-speaking pupil judicial and legal officers and court registrars over a period of four years based on quotas has also been ordered.

Jean Michel Nintcheu, Member of Parliament and Littoral Regional Chairman of the Social Democratic Front, SDF, has vowed that a planned sensitisation campaign on federalism and national unity will take place in Douala on March 4, in spite of a government ban The federalism  by Jean Marie Tchakui Moundie, Divisional Officer for Douala V in whose jurisdiction the sensitisation activities are scheduled to take place. The banned letter was signed on February 24 with instructions to the heads of the national gendarmerie and police force in the sub-division to enforce the injunction. The DO\u2019s decision followed a notification from the event organisers who informed the senior civil administrator in writing, about the occasion which includes a peaceful street march and a grand meeting. The SDF Member of Parliament, in a statement, insisted he and other organisers are going on with preparations and urged potential participants to disregard the DO\u2019s proscription. Hon. Nintcheu argues that the letter sent to the DO was not a request for authorisation. He pointed out that the 1990 law on public demonstrations prescribes the principle of declaration and not authorisation. He also criticised the DO\u2019s decision, claiming that it is against citizens\u2019 constitutional right to freedom expression. He contended that the divisional officer did not justify the reasons for the ban. But the decision, a copy of which Journal du Cameroun stumbled upon, states that the ban is intended to prevent a possible disruption of public order. The banned sensitisation campaign was planned to hold at time when a pressure group is also pressing for the return to federalism as a prerequisite for them to end a prolonged strike taking place in the English-speaking regions of the country. The Anglophone Civil Society Organisation, which transformed a  into a regional movement was outlawed on January 17, 2017. Its leaders at large are coordinating the strike from abroad while those arrested are facing trial for terrorism, rebellion, unlawful assembly etc. It should be recalled that the SDF has been advocating the restoration of federalism as the form of the state of Cameroon as far back as the early \u201890s. Cameroon was a federation of two states from the time of unification in 1961 to 1972.   ",

    "text": "Women in the North West and South West regions refused to take part in celebrations marking the 2017 edition of the International Women\u2019s Day. They boycotted the event in response to calls from the outlawed Anglophone Civil Society Consortium which requested that citizens in these regions should observe a ghost town on March 8, in protest of internet shutdown and detention of protesters seeking equality. We gathered women who took part in celebrations of this edition of the Women\u2019s Day in some major towns of the English-speaking regions were mainly staff of public institutions, some whom claimed to have been compelled to do so. A Bamenda city dweller who spoke to Journal du Cameroun yesterday at about noon, said there is no celebration in Bamenda. \u201cI am here at City Chemist Roundabout. This is where the cue of women\u2019s group waiting to march past at the Commercial Avenue usually starts. There is no one here and I don\u2019t see any woman in the Women\u2019s Day fabric. Shops are closed and only a few commercial bike riders are on the streets, probably boys from the West region\u201d our source said under condition of anonymity. He told Journal du Cameroun that it is possible a few women will march past in front of the grand stand at Commercial Avenue. \u201cBut I am not going up there. We know the type of people who shun our protests.\u201d He also informed us that he made some calls and found out that his home town of Kumbo has the appearance of a dead town. Other sources said the march past at the Bamenda Commercial Avenue lasted about 40minutes. Some women who boycotted the event, did not only remain indoors, but went about doing their usual daily activities. Such was the case in Bingo and Fundong in Boyo Division where concurrent sources told us, women rather went to work on their farms. We learned government however succeeded to organise low key commemorative activities in some other major cities across Anglophone regions such as Buea, Limbe, Mutengene and Kumba where the traditional march past only lasted 30 minutes. In a video message circulating on social media, Wilfred Tassang, Programs Coordinator of the Consortium thanks women for a \u201cresounding boycott of the Women\u2019s Day.\u201d \u201cYou have told the government that you want your husbands and your children to come back home and you have told the world that you are unhappy\u201d. He urged citizens to be steadfast in the protest and warned they will suffer a greater marginalisation if they give up on \u201cthe struggle\u201d for equality. Worthy of note is the fact that not only the outlawed Consortium\u2019s called for boycott of the women\u2019s day as part of its non-violent protest strategy in its struggle for the \u201crestoration of the statehood of West Cameroon\u201d. Edith Kah Wallah, Douala-based politician and social activist had equally called on women in Cameroon   on the celebration of this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Day. She reminded women in her call that children have been killed, leaders (of the protest) arrested, children are out of school, the economy of Cameroon is down and the rights of Cameroonians to communicate have been violated. Celebrations nonetheless, went on hitch-free in other regions of the country, with First Lady Chantal Biya gracing the event at the May 20 Blvd in Yaounde.  ",

    "text": "The decision last Saturday February 4, 2017 by some teachers\u2019 trade unions to call off a two month long protests against perceived economic marginalization and the imposition of French legal and education systems in the English-speaking regions of the country has been met with stiff resistance by the populations of the regions (North West and South West Regions.) Almost all schools and business in the North West and South West regions remained closed on Monday February 6. A couple of schools such as GBHS Molyko, Buea had a few students of their francophone sections present on campus. The interim consortium leaders who had called on citizens to disregards the teachers\u2019 decision, have continued to preach peaceful civic disobedience and condemn violence. However, some irate youths burnt down buildings in GTHS Barombi in the South West region and GBHS Nitop in the North West on February 6. Reports say the act was prompted by the school authorities\u2019 moves to disrespect the Ghost towns observed in the regions. Semma Valentine, Signed on behalf of CATTU \u00a9 Menchum Voice The pronouncement came after the All Anglophone Teachers Trade Unions decided to suspend their strike action and called on teachers, pupils and students to resume classes from Monday, February 6, 2017. They announced the suspension during a meeting at the North West Governor\u2019s Office. According to a declaration issued at the end of the meeting, the trade unionists had several consultations with their bureau members and acknowledged that the trade union leaders who called the strike have an obligation at some point to ask teachers to go back to school no matter what the community feels in keeping with the rights and privileges and duties and obligations of both employers and employees. They observed that the work of the Inter-ministerial Ad Hoc Committee ended up proposing solutions to 19 core issues plus six others in the form of an appeal. In the presence of Adolphe Lele L\u2019Afrique, Governor of the North West, the declaration was read out by Stephen Afu, President of the Presbyterian Education Authority Teachers Trade Union, PEATTU,. \u201cThe All Anglophone Teachers Trade Unions in unanimity elects this 4  of February 2017 to suspend the strike which they initiated on November 21, 2016 to address educational grievances,\u201d reads part of the declaration. As a consequence of this decision, they call for the resumption of effective classes on Monday the February 6, 2017 from 7:30 in the morning prompt. Valentine Semma, representative of the Cameroon Teachers Trade Union, CATTU, said the Ad Hoc Committee has convened an evaluation meeting to hold from February 15 to 20. While thanking all stakeholders for the enormous sacrifices made, the union leaders assure them in all earnestness that every effort will be deployed to see to it that all classroom actors burn the midnight candle and work with dedication in order that hapless children catch up the lost time and get adequate preparation for all their examinations. They implored teachers to make sure that these lofty aspirations are met while also imploring students to be responsible, focused, hardworking, disciplined and God-fearing to enhance the attainment of these dreams so dear to parents and the community at large. The All Anglophone Teachers Trade Union in their declaration expressed indignation at the heavy military presence in the two Anglophone Regions which they say has created an environment of insecurity, suspicion, uncertainty, violence, defiance and crime. They also mentioned the arrest and intimidation said to be orchestrated by government which they say has gone a very long way to complicate efforts aimed at seeking a way forward. The All Anglophone Teachers Trade Union also thanked those who made sacrifices, expressed condolences to those who lost people during the strike and assert that they reserve the right to lift the suspension of the strike anytime they feel convinced that government is not fulfilling nor honouring the pledges made in the Ad Hoc resolutions and recommendations. Afu told reporters that they haven\u2019t been manipulated but that the burden became so overbearing on the private sector. He reiterated that they are going to monitor government action and can call for a resumption of the strike if government is not responsible in its action. As for the leaders in prison, he said he does not know their fate but said his wish is that those in hiding can come out and continue the fight. Leaders of outlawed Consortium before their arrests and self-exile \u00a9 All rights reserved In a quick reaction to the decision of the All Anglophone Teachers Trade Unions calling off the strike, the  now led by Tapang Ivo and Mark Bara of the diaspora, described it as null and void. \u201cFellow West Cameroonians, we have all heard on Cameroon State broadcaster, CRTV that some leaders of teachers\u2019 unions have been coerced by government through the Governor of the North West Region to sign a release calling off the school boycott. We are all aware that the true leaders designated democratically by all the interest groups fighting for the liberation of Anglophones are either in detention or are on the run. \u201cWe have watched Mr Tassang Wilfred, Executive Secretary of CATTU on video from his hiding urging us all to remain firm until we get to the finish line. Those leaders decreed the boycott of 11th February and 20th May celebrations; the reason was to protect the future of our very children to ensure they do not face what we are seeing today. \u201cFinally, our leaders pointed out clearly that this strike action will only be called off at a press conference publicly. This means that whatever announcement you are getting on CRTV or other media calling off the strike is null and void and should be disregarded. CATTU has only one leader called Tassang Wilfred and so when another person signs for that union, it becomes apparent that this is yet another move of desperation from an ill-intentioned government. \u201cThe Consortium is therefore reiterating that the strike continues and we shall not celebrate 11th February anywhere in West Cameroon. Keep the ghost towns on Monday the 6th, Friday the 10th and Saturday the 11th of February, 2017.\u00a0God is with us!\u201d In the statement, the CACSC interim leaders further stated \u201cWe have been told government gave each of them 150 million and promised to fly out their families and themselves to Europe, so that your  should go in vain and their 11 February celebration saved. We must all say NO to them. Keep your children home until the real leaders are released!!\u201d The declaration suspending the strike was signed by Afu Stephen for the Presbyterian Education Authority Teacher Trade Union (PEATTU), Ayeah Emmanuella for Baptist Teachers Trade Union of Cameroon (BATTUC), Tameh Valentine for Teachers Association of Cameroon (TAC), and Semma Valentine who signed for the Cameroon Teachers Trade Union (CATTU) and on behalf of Tassang Wilfred the Executive Secretary General of CATTU whose whereabouts is unknown. Meanwhile, SYNES UB and the CEWOTU, that is, Catholic Education Workers Trade Union which has been transformed to CETTU, Catholic Education Teachers Trade Union did not sign.",

    "text": "Barrister Ndong was reacting to Barrister Jackson Ngnie Kamga\u2019s plea for common law lawyers to don their wigs and gowns and head back to the court rooms on Tuesday, May 2. Ngnie Kamga who is the President of the Cameroon Bar Council had told reporters on April 8, in Limbe, that his colleagues of the Northwest and Southwest Regions have resolved to resume work on May 2. Kamga argued that since government has made some concessions like the creation of a common law section in ENAM, the redeployment of judges taking into account their linguistic criteria and the increase in the number of english-speaking magistrates in the supreme court amongst others, which he says are signs of good faith, it was incumbent on the Anglophone lawyers to also show some magnanimity by resuming work. He said resuming work was going to give him the latitude to further his negotiations with government to cause the release of their two colleagues, Barrister Agbor Balla and Walters Abadem. But some common law layers like Barrister Ndong will have none of it. Christopher Ndong insisted over an interview he granted the BBC that government must first release their detained colleagues and others in yaounde before they can resume work and resume dialogue. \u201cAnglophone lawyers are ready to go back to court. But under certain conditions. First, common law lawyers and anglophones are in Kondengui prison because they are claiming their rights. So as long as our fellow lawyers and demonstrators are not released, we will not resume work,\u201d he said. Barrister Ndong also reiterated the position of Maurice Kamto, a legal practitioner and president of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement, who had slammed the Biya regime for use of brute force, unlawful arrest, intimidation, extortion and gross violation of human rights in the North West and South West regions over the past five months. Maurice Kamto had said government\u2019s recent concessions through the minister of justice is a ploy to play over lawyer\u2019s intelligence. \u201cWe all know that those measures have to go through a bill and tabled in the national assembly before it becomes law. Barrister Agbor Balla, Dr Fontem, Bibixy and the 25 others are charged for, among other crimes, terrorism, secession and destabilisation of public order; charges that carry very heavy jail terms. ",

I have informed him that people are being beaten up, arrested and intimidated in the North West and South West regions. I have told him to step in and say something or do something\u201d Fru Ndi told CRTV reporters in a live broadcast of the reception of the AFCON trophy at the presidency February 7. Let this politicians tell the truth. They sit down in Bamenda and write lies, blackmail people instead of solving problems. \u201cI quarrel out there with the minister of communicaton. I told him am a federalist and if he says that anybody who talks about federation should be arrested and locked up, he should bring his police and lock me up. Because he was saying there is no Anglophone problem as if he forgot about the Northern Memorandum which they wrote. You cannot be complaining and ask other people not to complain. I don\u2019t think that I want to live in a system which dictates and forces me to do things I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d Cornered to dwell on the success of the national football team which had just won the AFCON for the fifth time,the SDF chieftain he was touched by the goal keeper who dedicated the victory to the North West and had to congratulate him and ask the players to forge ahead. But noted, \u201cI came here with mixed feelings. I\u2019m rejoicing because the Indomitable Lions have won and raised the flag of Cameroon high. But in the North West and South West regions, the administration have pushed children to the point where they no longer respect that flag. The teachers\u2019 problem is not one that started today. It started a long time ago. They had to fight to get the GCE Board and other things and today they have started fighting and government pretends that there is no problem.\u201d Quizzed on the fact that schooling in the said regions have not been effective since November 21, 2016, he advanced that the people are not going to school because their teachers have been locked up in Yaounde. \u201c Others are on the run. I suggested to the governor of the North West that government should lift the ban on the teacher\u2019s union, release the people in jails and so that they can return to the dialogue table. He recalled that during the last meeting with the teachers held with the ministers of education in January, they agreed (on Saturday) that they were going to meet on Wednesday. On Tuesday, their organisation (The Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium) was banned and the leaders arrested and caused others to go into hiding where they are till date. \u201cHow can they ask teachers to go back to school? Do you think that they will be happy to go and teach when their colleagues have been locked up? Fru Ndi asked rhetorically, adding that some of them have been shot dead and authorities have continued to abduct children in the North West and South West regions and bringing them to Yaounde whereas there are competent courts in the regions. Observers say asking President Biya to personally handle an issue is a waste of time. They argue that the president has voluntarily promised to personally supervise certain state activities such as the construction of the Ring Road in the North West region, but the results still leave much to be desired.",

To him, other motives are needed to veil the real reason for their decisions. \u201cThey are looking for a way to coat his departure by masking his declarations about (supposed) homosexuals who run the CPDM\u201d, Zebaze wrote on his Facebook page last week.\u00a0It should be recalled that Prof. Messanga Nyamding did not mince his words when he made the said claims over TV. On March 19, politcian who is a lecturer at the International Relations Institute of Cameroon, IRIC, was guest on widely-watched   show on Canal 2 International- one of the second most watched TV station in Central Africa- according to a 2016 survey by Pan African magazine, Jeune Afrique. Quized on the legacy of the ruling party, 32 years on, the political scientist stated categorically that the CPDM has been infiltrated by cultists, most of whom he says, are \u201cFreemasons and homosexuals\u201d. It was recalled during the programme that he had, in one of his several publications, described the party as hell run by demons. But all through the show, he blamed the said demons for the failures of the 34-year old regime while defending its head, President Biya who has been in power for almost 35 years. According to the controversial CPDM official,\u00a0President Biya\u2019s plans for the party and the country are being shattered by disloyal party bigwigs. He also said\u00a0the ruling party hates the youth. \u201cIn our party, when you are younger than 50, they think you are too young (to hold posts of responsibilities). He also said if President Biya decides to step aside during the 2018 presidential election, it will be he, Messanga Nyamding, who will be presidential candidate for the CPDM party. He also pointed out that besides him, only Rene Sadi, territorial administration minister has the qualities to the Head of State. It should be noted that one of the interviewers in the programme apparently could not comprehend why an official would lambast his own party, to the extent of making baseless claims. He questioned the political scientists whether his reason for taking part of the programme was only to run down members of his party. Another interviewer asked why he, who is only an appointed official of the Central Committee, would attack elected officials the way he did. Prof. Messanga Nyamding hardly anwsered both questions directly. Benjamin Zebaze suggested some party officials felt defamed by the professor\u2019s utterances and have vowed to throw him out of the party. Homosexuality in Cameroon is a crime.",

    "text": "Barrister Nkongho Felix Agbor Balla, Dr. Fontem Neba and Mancho Bibixy\u00a0declared that they have no links with separatist groups who are advocating secession or independence for Southern Cameroon. Their statement was made known to the press March 1 by Barrister Bernard Achu Muna, lead lawyer for their defense. Barrister Muna said it was incumbent for the trio to clearly state their stand given the rise of many separatist movements who are seemingly taking   hostage with secessionist ideas. Hear him; \u201cSince this strike by lawyers and teachers started, a lot of other organisations have been trying to take advantage of what is happening in the North West and South West Regions, especially organisations that are preaching separation and the so-called independence of Southern Cameroon. That is why the leaders of the banned Consortium asked me to make a statement on their behalf.\u201d Muna holds that the trio have long been clamouring for the respect of the basic rights of Anglophones and not separation. Debunking claims on the consortium partnership with some separatist groups, Muna disclosed that Agbor Balla said the Consortium has never authorised anybody to sign any agreement with any of those groups. He said\u00a0the Consortium has no links with organisations promoting separation or independence of Southern Cameroons. Anybody negotiating with those groups is not acting on behalf of the Consortium. As the crisis drags on, many Cameroonians are of the opinion separatist movements, elites and some overzealous individuals are giving it a bad twist as they try to impose their presence on a national stage. Many groups like the Southern Cameroons National Council, SCNC, Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation, SCAPO, Ambazonia, Southern Cameroons Youth League, SCYL, Movement for the Restoration of the Independence of Southern Cameroon, MORISC, and Southern Cameroons South Africa Forum are using the struggle as an opportunity to hoist flags in various cities. Meanwhile media reports have revealed the creation of 77 GoFundMe accounts by some individuals to fund the Southern Cameroon crisis.\u00a0For one thing, Anglophone pundits are of the opinion that if groups like the SCNC disavowed their secessionist agenda in favour of a more pragmatic and inclusive approach to redressing the marginalization of the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, the protesters will have a strong case. Agbor Balla, Fontem Neba and Mancho Bibixy are expected to appear before the Yaound\u00e9   for a second time. Over 200 lawyers of the common law and civil law sub systems were in court on February 13, to defend the consortium leaders who are being charged with terrorism, secession rebellion and other related offences.",

Note that after more than 25years of existence, the party is still in the process of constructing a befitting secretariat or headquarters. The SDF which has for more than twenty years been advocating the change of the form of the state of Cameroon to a federal state, will use Saturday\u2019s meeting as an opportunity to chart the way forward to making this a reality. Cameroonians, especially those from the English-speaking regions have become cautious, better yet, scared, of talking publicly in favour of federalism. This is so, apparently because President Biya had declared earlier at the beginning of this year that the form of the state is not debatable- several citizens have been arrested and locked away for supporting the school of thought that Cameroon could be better governed as a federal state, an ideology which many Cameroonians erroneously consider to be the brain child of an outlawed pressure group, the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium created late last year. Hon Jean Michel Nintcheu, SDF MP was last month,   in the port city of Douala. He sued the civil administrator who banned the holding of the meeting and ordered security forces to ensure it does not hold. The outcome of the law suit is still awaited. Hon. Joseph Wirba, another SDF MP, is currently on   in the US. Hon. Joseph Banadzem, SDF parliamentary group leader, last week revealed that Martin Mbarga Nguele, the national police boss had   for the MP in violation of his parliamentary immunity. The MP was outspoken about the marginalisation of English-speaking Cameroonians. Besides these issues, the governing committee of the SDF is also expected to review reports on ground work that has already been done, and plan further activities in build up to the party\u2019s elective general assembly. We learned that the regional chairmen of the party, are expected to submit to the Secretary General, reports of primaries organised in their respective jurisdictions. The reports, we gathered, would be used to constitute delegations that would take part in next month\u2019s convention. The last NEC meeting was held in Bamenda on January 28, with the party bigwigs, drawing up a series of recommendations they believed would solve the on-going crisis in Anglophone Cameroon. It is expected that the next meeting would also examine how many of the recommendations were considered by government.",

In moments like this, it is very important for us to be prayerful because without God, we\u2019ll not be able to succeed on our own.

I have been carrying out my role but very quietly in order also not to fuel an already ominous situation.\u201d Nico Halle, above every other effort so far made in breaking the deadlock of the present crisis, also maintained \u201cMy prayer is that God should guide Cameroon, a peace-loving, law-abiding and God-fearing nation. God should guide all of us to be responsible and have a win-win dialogue and I am very convinced that Cameroon will come out of all of these crises a stronger nation. We have learnt from our mistakes and whether you like it or not, the Anglophone problem would have been solved for the most part. God should give the powers that be wisdom so that we can solve this problem in peace. I love peace, harmony and oneness.\u201d Nico Halle who also said he\u2019s apolitical, it would be recalled, has since the start of the current crisis, ensured that he makes his voice heard about how to get out of it. He has in past media outings called for genuine and frank dialogue between the aggrieved parties and government. \u201cFrank, honest and genuine dialogue, meaningful and sustainable peace, are a corollary of love, justice and equity. If these were to be implemented, peace will return to Cameroon and Cameroon will be a better nation\u201d he said.

The event organised in the wake of the prevailing Anglophone crisis which has threatened the peace of the country and in prelude to the upcoming national day is an initiative of the youth of the centre region. During the ground breaking event, various speakers and lecturers took turns in encouraging youth to be patriotic, preach national unity and shun secessionist tendencies, which they say, are propagated by a few individuals. According to them, when citizens love and respect state institutions, it encourages a stable economy that would attract foreign investors, and consequently usher in economic development. Varsity don, Professor Mathias Eric Owona Nguini, speaking on the uniqueness of the Cameroonian nation said youth need to maintain the legacy which fallen patriots fought hard to achieve. \u201cThe younger generation must try to preserve and consolidate this legacy, for this is what defines us Cameroonians as a people and a nation.\u201d On his part, Jean Baptiste Binyam Bakeck, a graduate from the International Relations Institute and PhD student urged youth to be advocates of peace. Talking on the Cameroonian youth and the axiology of peace, Mr. Binyam said for peace to thrive, all parties must take responsibility. Most of the activities during the forum gave the youth the opportunity to better understand and appreciate the need to live in unity and harmony, as they exchanged ideas and showed their unity in diversity. Meanwhile, in an ecumenical service, clergymen of various denominations prayed for peace, unity, economic growth and responsible citizenship. The clergy equally used the opportunity to appeal to those who wield political authority in Cameroon to use the rich natural, human and financial resources, which God has blessed the country with, to improve on the lives of the citizens.",

This is your moment in history in which all of you without exception, must stand together in the name of the suffering, oppressed and struggling people of West Cameroon! Our people have been mistreated, humiliated, tortured, jailed, exiled and others killed: merely for peacefully asking for their basic fundamental rights as a people with a distinct cultural heritage and a dignified way of life. They have endured systematic and traumatic abuse for over half a century and we all can testify that they have had enough!

Our children and their teachers have been out of school for months! Our lawyers have been out of court for much longer! The general masses from every village to every town have joined the struggle to take back our freedom! Our brothers and sisters in the diaspora have fought and struggled along with the people in every way imaginable!

God is with us and He will bless and protect you all for standing up for His People! Hon Joseph M. Wirba MP Member Of Parliament Cameroon National Assembly",

    "text": "Citizens of the South West region snubbed the caravan of the Cameroon International Cycling Tour which toured a few towns of the region on March 13. Reporters in the caravan say very few people came out to clap for cyclists along the streets; from the Kumba toll gate through other towns to the Limbe arrival ground. Reports from Limbe also say the pomp and fare that usually characterised the arrival ground during the past editions was missing yesterday. The snub of the event, analysts say, is linked to the ongoing protests marked by boycotts of public events in English-speaking regions of Cameroon. The massive deployment of troops and heavy artillery to secure the peaceful passage of the caravan, as reported by journalists in the South West region, lends credence to assertions that government had feared agitating youths in the region, would attempt to disrupt the  as part of the ongoing protests against what is commonly referred to as, Anglophone marginalisation. All along the race routes in the South West region, the caravan came across a heavily armed soldier after every 300 meters. Police officers were also posted in some areas to reinforce security. Other sources claim the visible security forces were just a tip of the iceberg. A source said to be reliable also hinted reporters in the region that a military jet was also ready on standby; prepared to engage for back up in the case of any eventuality. There was however no confrontation in the region as the majority of its inhabitants stayed indoors, apparently in respect of a weekly ghost town called by the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium. The Consortium has marked Mondays of every week as ghost town days in Anglophone regions. Intrinsically, citizens in some parts of the regions have nicknamed Monday \u2018Country Sunday\u2019 \u2013 a name which refers to traditional Sabbath days during which work is forbidden.",

    "text": "Prof. James Arrey Abangma and Sango Martin, respectively President and Vice President of\u00a0SYNES-UB, announced the strike suspension in Buea during a press conference on Friday March 24. During the press conference, the duo said they were suspending the strike and not calling it off. Dr.Abangma said their move to suspend the strike is in order to break the current deadlock to allow government to follow suit by releasing their arrested colleagues, students and implementing the various agreements reached at during the Adhoc Committee meetings. Responding to a question related to their detained colleagues; Dr. Fontem, Barrister Agbor Balla and others, Abangma said: \u201cI cannot betray my Secretary General, Dr.Fontem Neba. It is the duty of SYNES not to betray any of its members. Barrister Agbor Balla is also one of our members, what most people do not know is that Agbor Balla is a lecturer in UB, we cannot betray them.\u201d Citing the democratic nature of SYNES Buea Chapter, Abangma said he is not foiling Fontem\u2019s efforts or calling for those arrested not to be released or praising the government. Dr.Abangma says they expect government to restore internet facilities and demilitarise the academic communities. To him, government has the ace to make things return to normalcy. The SYNES Buea action comes after that of other teachers\u2019 syndicates which called off the strike, yet the strike continues unchanged with parents keeping their children away from school. Meantime, some members of SYNES Buea who pleaded for anonymity have dismissed the suspension of the strike saying the two SYNES officials have something they don\u2019t want to tell the other hundreds of members. They argue that before joining the strike, a meeting was held with all the members, and ask why Abangma and Sango did not call for a similar meeting before taking any action like suspension of the strike. To them, Abangma and Sango have just joined the TAC and CATTU officials, who, on their own, called off the strike but parents and their children have not heeded it.",

The News Agency of Nigeria reported on Sunday April 9, that the affected IDPs fled to Cameroon at the peak of the Boko Haram insurgency in the state. According to the report, the IDPs had a week ago urged the state government to facilitate their return home or they will trek back to Nigeria. Ahmad Satome, Chairman of the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, told journalists in Maiduguri that government plans to shelter the returnees in four temporary satellite camps. \u201cThe issue of the 78,000 Nigerian IDPs is purely a repatriation process, it is just to get them across the Cameroonian border back home. Once they are back we will get them transported to transit camps in Kumshe, Gulumba, Ngoshe and Kirawa where they will feed for a week or thereabout, so they can stabilize before asking them where they want to go,\u201d he said. Satome said that IDPs without any place to go would be kept in the camps while those who wanted to return home would be transported home. \u201cIDPs without homes or those whose communities are unsafe will be kept in the camps while those who want to return home will be transported home. \u201cBut for those who wished to remain in Cameroon they will be allowed to stay in accordance with the Geneva Convention,\u201d he said. Satome said government was focused on ensuring early return of all IDPs back to their communities especially those in areas liberated by the military. \u201cIt is true that government is resolute in ensuring all IDPs return home in a dignified manner in accordance to the Kampala convention. But sometimes, a lot of uncertainties come in,\u201d he said. He said the continued rescue of persons by the military from terrorist enclaves had created new IDPs requiring attention. \u201cThe intense pressure by the military on Boko Haram enclaves have led to rescue of new IDPs requiring care. This means that they have to be kept in camps for care and other humanitarian services,\u201d he said. Satome however said that government was resolute in moving IDPs who were interested in going back to camps close to their homes.  ",

Vittorio Colizzi, of the UNESCO office of the varsity, in address during the award ceremony in Italy, enumerated 20 points to justify the \u201chigh distinction\u201d among which is the controversial decision to offer 500,000 laptops to university students in Cameroon. Observers have criticised the inclusion of this decision among the list of achievements, arguing the decision had turned out to be one of the biggest scams of the Biya regime.\u00a0It should be recalled that Tamfu Arison, multiple award winning Cameroonian journalist, won the Africa Fact Checking Award for pointing out many falsehoods in the laptops deal. In the article published online on August 29, 2016 the reporter predicted that the jubilation that swept across institutions of higher learning will be short-lived because of the incongruities in the announced gift- it came to pass. The report pointed out among other things, that contrary to declarations that every student in institutions of higher education was going to benefit from the gesture, government data showed there were over 700,000 students enrolled in 170 institutions of higher education; 200 students more than the number of laptops. It also proved that the ICT equipment displayed by Minister Fame Ndongo, indicated that government was planning to distribute Netbooks not laptops.\u00a0Government had also noted that the 500,000 devices were going to cost 75billion FCFA. But the award winning reporter proved the total cost would be four times less than the declared amount. It was also proven in the report that the laptops were not a gift from President Biya as stated by the presidency, but rather a debt (loan from China EXIM Bank) that the students will have to contribute heavily to pay back with interest included. To prove the 500,000 \u201claptops\u201d deal was not worth an applause, Tamfu cited the case\u00a0of Ivory Coast. He wrote; n early 2016, the government of Ivory Coast signed an agreement with Universite de Cerco, a local higher institution to produce 4000 per day of \u2018Made in Cote D\u2019Ivoire\u2019 computers. The deal cost the government only 4billion FCFA\u201d. Analyst however say the medal cannot be discredited because of a single hitch. Among the other   were, the adoption of the Bachelor\u2013Master\u2013Doctorate (BMD) system and other university reforms; the creation of several ministries for the advancement of education, the growth in the number of schools in Cameroon(though reports say hundreds of schools exist only on documents), the putting in place of the 1998 law on the orientation of education, the rehabilitation of the national museum, the introduction of bonuses for deserving university students etc. The award ceremony, organised on the sidelines of President Biya\u2019s three-day visit to Italy on the invitation of the Italian President, took place in the premises of the University of Tor Vergata which has a  with the Chantal Biya Research Centre in Yaounde.",

To him, implementing decentralisation is a complicated situation that needs time since government cannot fulfil the demands of the process overnight. \u201cThe process of decentralisation is a complicated process, but what is certain is that government is bent on implementing the system. The process will continue and will go to an end even though some major challenges are faced.\u201d The Minister, revealed that the state has already transferred the commonly called \u201cwindscreen license\u201d royalties to regional and local authorities , the local development tax, a proportionate share of the supplementary municipal tax and a proportionate share of the annual forestry royalty. It was also disclosed that the state has repaid nearly FCFA 600 billion to regional and local authorities within the framework of transfer of powers. On why government has not put in place regional councils as stated by the constitution, the minister said the process is a gradual process and that with the putting in place of the Senate, there is hope that there is no turning back. It should be noted that pundits had recommended effective decentralisation as a strong solution to the ongoing Anglophone crisis. One of them, Chemuta Divine Banda, chairperson of the National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms, NCHRF, declared in February after a fact finding mission in the anglophone regions that the populace want effective decentralisation not secession. \u201cDecentralisation envisaged in the 1996 constitution should be urgently made effective,\u201d Dr Chemuta Divine Banda had recommended as part of solutions to the crisis rocking the english speaking regions.

The global average score is a paltry 43, indicating endemic corruption in a country\u2019s public sector.

This year\u2019s results highlight the , which feed off each other to create a vicious circle between corruption, unequal distribution of power in society, and unequal distribution of wealth.

In the write-up, he decries the fact that the lawmakers did not think it worthy to dedicate a session to the Anglophone crisis during the March sitting of parliament. Like Maurice Kamto, leader of the MRC polictical party, the CPDM parliamentarian criticised the fact that more attention is focused on the war against Boko Haram while the ongoing protests that have   in the North West and South West region is ignored. Jean-Simon Ongola points out that both the war against Boko Haram and the Anglophone protest threaten the peace and serenity of Cameroon. According to Jean Simon Ongola, the silence of parliament justifies the people\u2019s decision to disown their parliamentarians. Indeed, since elected officials have been given the mandate of the people to represent them, they have a duty to pass on their concerns so that solutions can be sought during debates in parliament, he says. He also noted that many parliamentarians are disconnected from the reality of the people they are supposed to represent in parliament. To him, the MPs and Senators are not even aware of the poverty, unemployment, social injustice, and other difficulties their citizens face. To him, what is worse is the fact that some of them are over-zealous and act beyond what they call party discipline. The CPDM MP expressed his disappointment at the fact that sometimes some topics discussed in specialized committees of the National Assembly are swept aside by people with an approximate or inaccurate knowledge of the experiences of citizens. This passiveness of the people\u2019s representatives is enough to transform parliament into a registration chamber which makes the executive power stronger than it is supposed to be. Jean-Simon Ongola, in the write-up, sent a clarion call on his colleagues to step up their commitment to the common interest. He said there is need for parliamentarians to change the negative image of Parliament already embedded in citizens. The MP also called on parliamentarians to better interprete texts by calling on outside expertise for a better understanding of the changes taking place in the society. He urged members of the lower and upper houses of parliament to revisit the role of the National Assembly and kill the notion that the country is\u00a0run by a few civil servants who hide the truth from the people.",

He equally urged the fruit sellers to respect the present order so as to avoid any unfavourable measures the council might take against them. Nevertheless, we learned from reporters in Buea that the ghost town called in protest against the celebration of the anniversary of the CPDM in Anglophone regions this March 24, was effective as of this morning. Our sources said by 8:30 am, shops which are normally opened at this time, were still closed. \u201cThe streets are void of people, though I can see empty taxis begging for passengers\u201d one of the reporters told Journal du Cameroun. It should be noted that the emblamtic and development oriented mayor of Buea has taken several measures to curb the impact on his municipality, of the   in the North West and South West regions. He is reported to have provided 20 taxis for trasportation within his jurisdiction; to be used particularly on days when the outlawed Consortium orders businesses and movements along the streets should be halted. The boss of the town, popularly known for its legendary hospitality, has equally made repeated calls on parents to send their children back to school in order to secure a better future for them. He has however been criticised for sending his children to study in schools which are not only out of his municipality, but in far-away Yaounde where citizens are reportedly secure and free from the fallouts of the on-going strike. His critics argue he should teach by example to avert being trampled upon by his political adversaries.",

    "text": "The outlawed Anglophone Civil Society Consortium which is championing the protests, have responded to the publication of the new timetable, by intensifying calls for boycott of schools and festive days in the regions. Jean Ernest Maxime Ngalle Behene, Minister of Secondary Education signed a communique on Friday March 3, announcing some of the measures taken to enable the English-speaking regions meet the 2016/2017 pedagogic planning. These included the increase of 17hours of teaching per week in the Anglophone sections from Monday March 6 to May 13. In the communique that is copied the prime minister\u2019s office, the GCE board, Baccalaureate board among others, the minister outlines the schedule. It says teachers would have to teach two extra hours every day of the week, except Wednesdays on which they would have to teach three extra hours. Students in the Anglo-Saxon subsystem of education in the English-speaking regions will not have Easter holiday this year. Students who are not in examination classes will attend classes only for one week during the Easter holiday which, according to the minister\u2019s decision, will run from March 31 to April 17. The deadline for registration for the GCE has also been extended once again; this time around to March 20. Philemon Yang, Prime Minister and head of government will tour all the seven divisions of the North West region next week. This, it is reported, is another move to thwart the   and get schools operational. The PM is allegedly planning to meet with teachers, parents and local authorities in the divisions. Since the publication of the minister\u2019s announcement of measures to save the school year, the proscribed Anglophone Civil Society Consortium has multiplies calls for boycott of classes, respect of its call for ghost towns to be observed every Monday. They are also calling on the boycott of women\u2019s day celebration. The consortium leaders have since Friday, been struggling to provide reasons why schools in the North West and South West region should remain close. In numerous the Consortium claims government has not fulfilled promises to resolve the problems which caused teachers and lawyers to paralyze schools and courts in the English-speaking regions. The   are in an intensified campaign that appeals to the consciences of Anglophones. They urge citizens to recall the reasons the strike started in the first place. They also remind citizens of the killings, arrests, abuses and detentions as well as the on-going trial of the strike leaders and the frustrations of some of the protest leaders currently on the run. The messages are relayed via social media and SMS. Tapang Ivo TanKu of the Consortium, revealed in a recorded video that every message of the organisation is sent by SMS to 800,000 citizens in the North West and South West regions of the country. They also claimed that there are some unidentified individuals who have taken upon themselves to brutalise everyone who attempts to disrupt what is known among many Anglophones as \u201cthe struggle for restoration of the statehood of West Cameroon\u201d. Most of the texts, a couple of which Journal du Cameroun stumbled upon, end with \u201cread, share and delete.\u201d We gathered, this was introduced after reports that people are being arrested and detained for possessing strike-related messages in their phones. The consortium also highlights the fact that the protest is no longer that of teachers and lawyers only. It should however be noted that contrary to the Consortium\u2019s claims, government has started granting some of the demands of both the lawyers and teachers who started the strike. The recent creation of a department of French Modern Letters in the University of Bamenda and the translation of the OHADA texts are some of the actions taken in that direction. The systematic and gradual redeployment of Francophone teachers to schools of the French subsystem of education and Francophone magistrates to Civil Law courts is also underway. ",

    "text": "The visit by the UN Rights chief accompanied by his deputy, Abdoulaye Traore, came days after Francois Fall, the special representative of the UN Secretary General for Central Africa and Head of UNOCA had paid a similar visit to the Kondengui prison. In a statement at the start of his visit to Kondengui, the UN Human Rights chief said, their mission to the detention facility was to evaluate the conditions under which persons arrested in the North West and South West Regions were being detained. During a working session with the detainees in the office of the Registrar of the Yaounde principal prison, the UN Human Rights expert listened with rapt attention to the 12  Barrister Felix Agbor \u2018Balla\u2019 Nkongho, President of the outlawed Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium, who spoke on behalf of the detainees, expressed regrets that the UN Human Rights office took interest in what has now been termed the \u2018\u2019Anglophone crisis\u2019\u2019 a little too late. He said for an office based in Yaounde, it is surprising that they were coming to visit the detainees close to 90 days after they were arrested from across the North West and South West Regions and transported to Yaounde. \u201cWe expected a better and prompt response from the office of the UN Rights commission\u201d Agbor Balla said. He however welcomed the visit of the UN Human Rights chief hoping that though their visit is a little too late, it will go a long way to ensure the release of the detainees. \u201cBetter late than never; it is a good thing that you have come to visit us. Most of us being held in detention centres around Yaounde have not been charged by any court. In fact, most of the detainees do not even know why they are here. None of us here has committed any crime\u201d the president of the proscribed Consortium told the visiting UN delegation. Beside the inhumane manner in which most of the detainees were arrested and transported to Yaounde, Barrister Agbor Balla cited a plethora of difficulties faced by the detainees who were all arrested and detained far away from their homes. \u201cIt is very costly to have our friends and relatives visit us. Visitors have to spend a fortune to transport themselves from the South West and North West Regions to Yaounde. Taking the floor minutes later, Dr. Fontem Neba, Secretary General of the banned consortium, recounted the inhumane manner in which he, together with Barrister Agbor Balla, were arrested. He said he has since had issues with his spine and his limbs. Dr. Fontem Neba regretted that he has been unable to get medical care, coupled with the fact that his bank accounts have been blocked by government. Several other speakers who took to the floor narrated their ordeal to the UN Human Rights chief for Central Africa. It was Atia Tilarious Azohnwi, President of the Buea Chapter of the Cameroon Association of English-speaking Journalists, CAMASEJ, who is also Political Desk editor of Limbe-based weekly tabloid,  , who wondered why government denied a visa to the Head of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, CPJ, who was due to visit detained journalists in Cameroon. Atia expressed the wish that all those detained as a result of the ongoing Anglophone crisis should be released. In response to the issues raised by the detainees, the UN Human Rights chief regretted that because of administrative bottlenecks and procedural red tape, they were visiting Anglophones up to 90 days after they were arrested. \u201cThe state prosecutor (Commissaire de Gouvernement) only granted our request to visit you on Monday April 17. We had to write to the Ministry of External Relations and other related Ministries before our visit could be made possible. You know that the international community is very systematic. Just know that we have had no rest since this problem started. We are exploring and exploiting all avenues to get solutions to the problems in the North West and South West Regions and also to ensure that you all are released \u201cthe UN official pledged. \u201cJust like you all have had no sleep since this problem started, we of the international community have had no sleep as well. We are very much touched by what is going on\u201d he added. Before leaving Kondengui, the UN Human Right official promised to make the necessary interventions at the appropriate quarters for a return of normalcy in the Anglophone Regions.",

    "title": "Bishops\u2019 school resumption crusade meets resistance in Buea",
    "text": "We gathered in a bid to ensure the resumption of schools, the Bishops, led by Archbishop Samuel Kleda who chairs the Episcopal Conference, decided to visit the Dioceses of Buea, Kumba, Mamfe and Bamenda archdiocese. Reports from the South West region say Archbishop Kleda\u2019s mission to Buea on May 2 ended in a fiasco. He convened a meeting with all school administrators in the diocese and attempted to persuade them alongside the Bishop of Buea to call on parents to send their children back to school. We learned some attendees of the meeting insisted schools could resume only if all Anglophones arrested within the framework of the ongoing protest are released. The Buea school administrators rather added their voices to those of influential national and international institutions to propose frank dialogue as the way to go in finding lasting solutions to the crisis in the Anglophone regions. The Bishop of Buea for his part, we learnt, reiterated that the decision to send children back to school is to be made by parents. Though the head of the episcopal council and his suit advanced reasonable justifications for the strike to be called off, Mark Bareta, one of the activists spearheading the protests from abroad, insists the Bishops outing is not in the interests of the people. It should be recalled that Bishops of the Bamenda Ecclesiastical Province (Anglophone Bishops) had issued a memo to President Biya at the beginning of the protests last year. The Memo justified the reasons for regional outcry and proposed a way forward. Today they have been dragged to court alongside other clergy from the Baptists and Presbyterian churches for allegedly supporting protesters. Significant national and international actors had since endorsed the proposal of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve the crisis made by the Bishops of the Ecclesiastical Province of Bamenda. From the late palliatives announced by the government, it is obvious that some of the proposals made by the Bishops of the Ecclesiastical Province of Bamenda might have influenced governmental action Chief Charles A. Taku, Political analyst, says of the letter of the Bishops of Cameroon (written after last week\u2019s meeting) is actuated by political rather than Christian motivations. \u201cTheir peers in the Bamenda Ecclesiastical Province and a significant number of clerics from many denominations have contemporaneously denounced the ongoing egregious violations on armless citizens, the politicisation of military justice, the genocide, the cultural genocide and several international crimes that have shocked the conscience of humanity in the territory of the Southern Cameroons. These late and timid reactions exposes these prelates as shepherds that abandoned the flock in time of need;\u201dhe says. The analysts says of the Bishops (predominantly francophones) who after the letter engaged in a \u2018school resumption crusade\u2019: By omission or by practicing the gospel of Pontius Pilate, they may by default be emboldening and strengthening the hand of tyranny. Their unfortunate ploy to balance their cursory concerns of the legally and morally unjustified use of excessive force by state actors who are bound by the Geneva Conventions (1949) to respect the sanctity of civilian lives, avoid actions in their deployments that will harm civilians and civilian targets is regrettable. If the actions of these prelates is intended to secure a place for them in a future comprehensive dialogue to resolve the crisis, I am afraid, they have overplayed their relevance. The crisis concerns the Ecclesiastical Province of Bamenda. The Bishops of this Ecclesiastical Province have spoken and we have taken note. Along with the Church, they are presently persecuted by proxy using senior members of the military who by military discipline will not form or be members of activist civil society associations. The bastardisation of the educational system harms Catholic education and the social teachings of the Church. The question, I must ask, who stands to gain from these crimes? And who stands to gain from the persecution of the prelates and church leaders? \u2026I strongly urge the Bishops of Cameroon to advice the government of Cameroon to critically read the letter of the Bishops of the Ecclesiastical Province of Bamenda in which they confronted the truth with biblical inspiration and the faith in the Christian values. For this reason, they letters are unnecessary and unwarranted.",

The report also reveals that many of these inmates are forced to kneel with bare skin on the rough ground and walk on their knees.

The president of the local anti-terrorism group says they cannot declare the missing fighter dead, because he might be lost in the bushes. Mahama Oumate buttressed his argument with the fact that it was the first time the missing group member was taking part in an operation. Another group member told reporters on the ground that they still hope he will find his way home. During the attack on March 11, the vigilante group, after taking down six from a group of seven attackers, was later forced to vamoose into nearby bushes as numerous heavily armed terrorists rushed to the rescue of their fellow extremists. The attack took place on March 11 in Wada, a locality in the Far North region covered by the Zamga Vigilante group. According to the group\u2019s president, Mahama Oumate, 30 of them were hiding in a bush with their habitual artisanal weapons. When they detected that the intruders from Nigeria were terrorists, they immediately opened fire, killing six of them on the spot. Mahama Oumate revealed that when they tried to chase the remaining terrorist, another cohort of assailants emerged from behind him. They exchanged fire until they realised they were outnumbered and had run out of ammunitions. He also revealed that the attackers had more sophisticated weapons. Despite their retreat, the terrorists could no longer continue their trip to Cameroon as they fled back into the Nigerian towns of Tchinini and Agapalao. Vigilante groups in localities at risk of Boko Haram, have been working in synergy lately.

According to party sources, it will be an occasion to proceed with the re-election of members of the party\u2019s governing organ, the Central Committee. The welcoming of new militants as well as renewal of all the structures of the party also features on the planned activities of the congress. The holding of the NUDP ordinary was confirmed to press by Mohamadou Talba, the party\u2019s national communication secretary. \u201cWe are in the midst of the preparations; I must say that such a congress occurs every 5 years. After the congresses of 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, it is normal to organize the one of 2017 according to our statutes,\u201d he said. The convening of the congress comes barely one year before the 2018 presidential election. Mohamadou Talba, says the congress will dictate the prospects for 2018.The February 25, 2017 NUDP Sixth Ordinary Congress will most likely see the re-election of Bello Bouba Maigari as the party\u2019s National President. The NUDP Congress will be coming at a time when the party has been gaining steam in recent months as 2018 which is an election year in Cameroon approaches. Recently, some 480 militants of the ruling Cameroon People\u2019s Democratic Movement, CPDM party and the Cameroon National Salvation Front, CNSF party of Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary resigned and joined the NUDP section of Mayo-Ourna. The militants were from the villages of Tcharatch\u00e9 and Banli, in the Mayo-Ourna Sub Division of the Benou\u00e9 Division. The reception ceremony for the defectors was chaired by Iya Boro Ahmadou, member of the central committee of the NUDP and the personal representative of the National President, Bello Bouba Maigari. For the occasion, a meeting was held in the town of Bardark\u00e9 where the new NUDP militants received party uniforms and their individual membership cards. According to explanations from the NUDP Mayo-Ourna Section President, Alhaji Oumarou Mouhamadou Nana, the reception ceremony of the new militants was a culmination of a long process initiated by the converts a few weeks ago. \u201cWe reassured ourselves of the sincerity of the new militants we presented to the general public. They made their desire to join the NUDP since November 2016\u201d, Alhaji Nana noted. According to Sanda Madi, leader of the CPDM decamping militants of the Mayo-Ourna Sub Division, they acted for the benefit of their locality. \u201cWe realized that the CPDM was using us and our interests were not considered.

His most recent questions were on UN missions that had to be sent to Cameroon for investigations in the on-going protests against a perceived marginalisation, and requests for independence for the former British Southern Cameroons. He was told another mission will visit Cameroon this month. He also questioned what the UN is doing about the closed to 8o days of internet blackout in English-speaking Cameroon. Lee also asked whether the UN was going to allow Cameroon be signatory to the UN convention on the use of electronic communications in international contracts when the country has deprived millions of citizens of internet connectivity for more than two months. He also exposes inertia in the management of UN affairs in Cameroon, noting that UNICEF Cameroon\u2019s website was last updated in 2012 and the two top press releases were about Nigeria. He was told it is the country representative of this UN agency that is playing the role of UN Resident Coordinator. In   of April 5, on Cameroon, he wrote: \u201cSo on April 5,   asked the UN Spokesperson\u2019s Office, Associate Spokesperson Eri Kaneko, what if anything the UN has done about the Internet cut.

Some officials of the party have repeatedly stated on several occasions that government only introduced decentralisation in the 1996 constitution as an excuse to turn away from federalism. The banned sensitisation campaign was planned to hold at time when a pressure group is also pressing for the return to federalism as a prerequisite for them to end a prolonged strike taking place in the English-speaking regions of the country.

When Inner City Press first asked the UN spokespeople, they said they hadn\u2019t heard of it. (Later lead spokesman Stephane Dujarric would say that criticism by   of the UN\u2019s then-Resident Coordinator Najat Rochdi for silence on the issue verged on  ). When the UN Security Council visited Cameroon, only one member \u2013 Sweden \u2013 said the issue had been raised, in only informally. That answer came via Twitter Direct Message. Back at the entrance to the Security Council chamber, French Ambassador Francois Delattre told Inner City Press he was unaware of the Internet cut by Paul Biya, whom France has long supported.   Delattre said he would revert with a response but has yet to by the time of this writing weeks later. On UN Television UK ambassador Matthew Rycroft said his country was aware of the plight of Cameroon\u2019s Anglophones but did not think it constituted a threat to international peace and security. He added, as not transcribed by the UK Mission to the UN, that the UK keeps the situation under constant review \u2013 he\u2019s said the same thing about continued arms sales to Saudi Arabia to use in air strikes on Yemen.

The verdict of the hearing which took place behind closed doors on March 16, is expected to be declared on Tuesday March 21. He was defended by Prof Maurice Kamto and Barister Kisob while the Commissioner for government who ought to represent the state was absent for health reasons. The press was denied access to the hearing, but we however got a narration from the publicist of the magistrate cum politician. Editor\u2019s note: The narration may be totally void of objectivity, readers\u2019 discretion is advised. Read on: \u201c\u2026you did not arrest but abducted me because I am anglophone. A similar thing you did to the Consortium leaders\u2026\u201d \u2013 A friend, the wife of one of the prosecuting lawyers hinted me. Deputy Attorney General of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Ayah Paul Abine who doubles as President of Popular Action Party, PAP appeared in close session earlier at 11:00am before the Mfoundi High Court. The Commissioner for Government who had to represent the state of Cameroon was absent. He was said to have fallen sick in the early hours of the moring. Regular judicial proceedings warrant that Ayah\u2019s lawyers should have been served with all documents pertaining to the case. Government\u2019s legal department were able to present some doubtful documents only today in court. They failed to present the warrant of arrest. Ayah was seen helping out his own lawyers on several occasions. The judicial gymnastics of this very learned Chief Justice may have caused the lawyers and judges to contemplate going for retraining. Ayah began with the first by quoting Section 119 (4) of the Penal Code which forbids the arrest of persons on the weekend. Ayah, it should be noted, was bundled out of his Tam-Tam residence by heavily armed men on Saturday January 21, 2017. Secondly, the Lord Justice cited Section 629 of the Criminal Procedure Code that clearly spells out the judicial procedures for a judge of his calibre to be arrested; prominent amongst which is the fact that three judges equal to or superior in rank to Justice Ayah were competent enough to form a panel to only interrogate and not effect an arrest. More so, for such a panel to be constituted, the order had to come through the head of his department, in this case, the Attorney General of the Supreme Court. All of these procedures were flouted! Chief Justice Ayah\u2019s judicial \u2018homily\u2019 got the President of the Mfoundi High Court nodding in the affirmative all through. At one instance, the lectures were so embarrassing to the government camp in ways that there was complete dead silence. Ayah challenged the prosecution team to brandish any evidence warranting that he be arrested even if they did not have the right to arrest him. The judges turned with expectation to the direction of the prosecution team who replied with a gaze of complete bewilderment by a skew of eyebrows. They had no evidence. Justice Ayah seized the occasion to inform whoever cared to listen that his gut feeling tells him that Laurent Esso (Minister of Justice), Rene Emmanuel SADI (Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation), Jacque Famme Ndongo (Minister of Higher Education), Issa Tchiroma (Minister of Commuincation) in complicity with top notch Anglophones were behind the embarrassment of the state. By the end of the hearing, some judges and the entire prosecuting team looked pale and embarrassed. They were so much outplayed such that they refused to return greetings after the court session. This report would be incomplete without mentioning that, all through the session, the prosecution team did not, even for once, object to what Ayah said the entire time. by Akoson ",

    "text": "Barrister Jackson Ngnie Kamga, President of the Cameroon Bar Council, had announced earlier on April 9, that Anglophone Lawyers have resolved to don their wigs and gowns and head back to the court rooms on Tuesday, May 2, 2017. However, reports on the field on May 2, say courts in Bamenda and Buea, chief towns of the North West and South West regions respectively, still remain closed. Barrister Ngnie Kamga\u2019s public declaration had   from proponents of the Anglophone struggle with many calling the move as\u00a0a desperate attempt by the Biya regime to lure them back into the courtrooms. Barristers Harmony Bobga and Elias Eyambe Ebai, Presidents of NOWELA and MELA, respectively, who are both at large had asserted that the Bar President has no moral authority to call off a strike he did not initiate. Another set of criticism came from the outlawed Anglophone Consortium leaders who condemned the bar president\u2019s actions. In an April 10\u00a0press release, the Consortium leaders wrote: \u201cThe Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium, CACSC, has taken note of a\u00a0press release\u00a0issued by the President of the Cameroon Bar Association, Jackson Ngnie Kamga, alleging a series of meetings with some so-called \u201cvery senior\u201d lawyers in Bamenda and Buea, which meetings recommended that the Bar President was \u201chereby authorised to enter into dialogue with the Government on matters bearing on the Common Law Lawyers\u2026 and that advocates of the Southwest and Northwest Regions shall\u00a0resume\u00a0work on the May 2, 2017\u2026 The Consortium wishes to remind all and sundry that Barrister Ngnie Kamga is not a Common Law Lawyer, does not know anything concerning the Common Law and is well aware of the existence of four Common Law Lawyers\u2019 Associations into which all the said lawyers are regrouped; Fako Lawyers Association, FAKLA, Meme Lawyers Association, MELA, Manyu Lawyers Association, MALA and the Northwest Lawyers Association, NOWELA, and their presidents, who were the only ones initially mandated to talk on their behalf. That means any meeting and resolutions arrived at with any so-called \u201cvery senior\u201d lawyers and the resolutions thereof are null and void. Further, Barrister Ngnie Kamga is not unaware that the Common Law Lawyers   working for the restoration of the Statehood of Southern Cameroons to form the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium and made it the sole body to handle any issues with the Government \u2013 where it could become necessary. This simply means no one, except the Consortium, through its elected representatives, some of whom are in detention and others on the run, have the power to conduct any negotiations on behalf of Common Law Lawyers. Regarding the so-called promises made by the Government, through the Minister of State, Minister of Justice and Keeper of the Seals to redeem demands made several months ago by Common Law Lawyers, the Consortium made it clear that the measures which mostly represented political promises, which could at any time be swept under the carpet, were too little and came too late. We are calling on both national and international opinion to witness that the Biya-led regime can never be trusted at any time and instances abound to prove this point; where are the laptops promised to\u00a0University\u00a0students over one year today? Where is the FCFA 2 billion subvention promised to lay private and mission\u00a0schools\u00a0in Cameroon about five months back? Where is the ring-road Mr. Biya promised the people of the Northwest Region he would personally supervise over 22 years ago? Thus, any reference to those promises, made worse with the inclusion of conditions, will be regarded henceforth as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition towards the peace loving people of the Southern Cameroons and shall be tantamount to unnecessary provocation.\u201d The Cameroon Bar had  faulted the common law lawyers for undermining the authority of the bar council and that of the bar association as a whole. It stated in a counter release, signed by its Secretary General on behalf of the President, the institution had powers to act in the interest of all lawyers in Cameroon regardless whether they are civil law lawyers or common law lawyers.

He said he would travel to the chief towns of the regions in May to ensure the effective start of work in courts. He would work with government to ensure that it fulfils its promises and also press for the liberation of two lawyers facing charges of terrorism and rebellion at the Yaounde Military Tribunal, he said. Barrister Ngnie Kamnga\u2019s interview was granted to bolster understanding of a press statement he signed on April 9. The release read: \u201c\u2026advocates of the South West and North West regions shall\u00a0resume\u00a0work on the 2nd May 2017, for the resolutions of the ad hoc committee submitted to the Prime Minister and approved by the Head of States to be fully implemented\u201d.It also said the lawyers authorized him to enter into dialogue with the government on matters bearing on the Common Law lawyers. Leaders of Common Law associations have made scathing remarks on the Batonnier\u2019s press statement. They argue he is \u201cnot a Common Law lawyer and is well aware of the existence of four Common Law lawyers\u2019 associations; Fako Lawyers Association, Meme Lawyers Association, Manyu Lawyers Association- and the North West Lawyers Association, and their presidents, who were the only ones initially mandated to talk on their behalf. That means any meeting and resolutions arrived at with any so-called \u201cvery senior\u201d lawyers and the resolutions thereof are null and void.\u201d Barrister Elias Eyambe Ebai, President of Meme Lawyers Association, who escaped after government started arresting the leaders with whom it held unsuccessful dialogue, also criticised the Batonier.\u201dSome few lawyers were gathered from the North West and South West and in a state-sponsored meeting held in Bamenda and Buea recommending the resumption of practice. The majority of lawyers are totally against this move. And I reject it outrightly.\u201d Eyambe said in a statement. Barrister Harmony Bobga, President of North West Lawyers Association (also on the run) wrote: \u201cNotice is hereby given to all common law lawyers that it is not within the competence of Mr. Kamga who is not part of the common law bar to speak for us. He has all along lent his support to anti-common law philosophy and organization. He lacks the competence to commit us. On your behalf I condemn and reject the dirty game. Whoever amongst us is party to the deal is\u00a0free\u00a0to go with their chosen partners. We stand by what we resolved and no less.\u201d The   Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium also issued a statement condemning calls for Lawyers in the Anglophone regions to resume work. \u201cBarrister Jackson Ngnie Kamga is not unaware that the Common Law Lawyers had joined other civil society associations working for the restoration of the statehood of Southern Cameroons to form the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium and made it the sole body to handle any issues with the government \u2013 where it could become necessary. This simply means no one, except the Consortium, through its elected representatives \u2013 some of whom are in detention and others on the run, have the power to conduct any negotiations on behalf of Common Law Lawyers.\u201d the statement read in part. Barrister  , President of the outlawed pressure group who doubles as President of the Fako Lawyers Association has been in detention since January 17.",

The video posted on Youtube on April 1, by   is the first video in which leaders of the Nigeria-based terror group speak in French, displaying ammunitions and supplies supposedly belonging to Cameroonian soldiers. \u201cI will decapitate you Paul Biya with the left hand, be ready,\u201d one of the fighters says in French, holding up President Biya\u2019s photo in a news magazine. The terrorist who refers to President Biya as the great Christian, drops the magazine to the ground and stamps his foot on it, reiterating his desire to chop off Biya\u2019s head. He also insults the Cameroonian Head of State, calling him a sluggard in the video which is about six minutes and thirty seconds long. The lone speaker in the video which opens with heavy firing of gunshots, tells residents of Maroua, Garoua, Ngaoundere and Ebolowa that they are coming for them. \u201cWe are ready to come. We are on our way to Maroua, Garoua and Ngaoundere. We are on our way to Ebolowa, Yaounde\u2026we will arrive in God\u2019s name,\u201d he says. Besides the utterances, the man who appears to be one of the commanders of the terror group brags about chasing away Cameroonian soldiers from their camp. \u201cThese are shoes they left behind, these are their helmets they left behind, these are their mats for prayers they left behind. They are fighting God and praying again. I do not understand why you\u2019re still praying?\u201d the so-called jihadist says in French. The Nigeria terrorist group extended its activities to Cameroon in 2014. It insurgents have so far killed more than 150\u00a0Cameroonian soldiers and about 2000 civilians in more than 500 attacks. Weakened by a joint multinational taskforce made up of soldiers from countries of the Lake Chad basin, the so-called Islamist group changed its modus operandi in the past couple of years. They switched from attacking villages in groups to using children as suicide bombers. Reports say the group has killed over 50 Cameroonians in suicide bombings while sixty other bombers blew up themselves without killing anyone else. The latest suicide attack took place in the town of Mora today, March 3; only the two attackers were killed. Both Cameroonian and Nigerian governments have repeatedly stated that the war against Boko Haram is almost over. The group was recently chased out of its abode in the Sambiza forest in Nigeria. Sources say what is left of the gang is hiding in the Mandara moutains in Cameroon\u2019s Far North region and some areas around the Lake Chad.  ",

He says the church had earlier turned down a request by organisers of the FENASCO B games who wanted to use the Church\u2019s field for the tournament. Going by the Reverend Father, the church had been warned not to let government use its facilities for the competition for primary schools. The threats, it would appear, came from citizens supporting the on-going protests against a perceived marginalisation of English-speaking Cameroon; the North West and South West regions. A source at the Cameroon Baptist Convention told Journal du Cameroun that a similar incident was witnessed at the headquarters of the convention. The source, a staff at the Baptists Centre, said the Baptist Church had also turned down a request from the FENASCO B games organising committee.

Our source said CBC officials sent them home for fear that security forces may clash with protesters in a possible attempt to use the premises by force. There was however no clash, as protesters rather boycotted the event and stayed indoors. It should be recalled that the outlawed Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium had called on citizens of the North West and South West regions to boycott the FENASCO A and B sporting events. Both sporting jamborees are competitions organised by the ministries of secondary and primary education for secondary and primary schools. Schools from all ten regions of the country take part in the competitions which often take place simultaneously in two regions of the country. Another source from the CBC said they could overhear most of the pupils who took part in competitions at the Church\u2019s sporting ground, speaking French; suggesting that Angophone parents did not let their children take part in the competitions. Goverment nonetheless succeeded to organise the competitions in the two main cities of English-speaking Cameroon amid a tense socio-political atmosphere.\u00a0The West Region emerged champions in the games in Bamenda. They topped the medals chart with 12 gold medals, six silver and six bronze ahead of the Littoral region with nine gold and the North West region, seven gold.  ",

Marie-Pierre Poirier, Unicef\u2019s regional director for West and Central Africa says the very sight of children near marketplaces and checkpoints is sparking fear and has caused nearly 1 500 children to be detained last year across Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad. \u201cThese children are victims, not perpetrators,\u201d Poirier said. \u201cForcing or deceiving them into committing such horrific acts is reprehensible.\u201d According to a report released Wednesday April 19 by the UN children\u2019s agency, at least 117 attacks have been carried out by youth in the Lake Chad basin region since 2014, with nearly 80% of the bombs strapped to girls, who were sometimes drugged before their missions. Wednesday\u2019s report coincides with this weeks\u2019 third anniversary of the mass abduction of Nigerian Chibok schoolgirls by Boko Haram, which has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. The mass abduction of 276 girls from a boarding school in Nigeria mobilised an international campaign to find and free the girls, many of whom were forced into marriages with fighters and became pregnant. In the report, Unicef emphasised that beyond the high-profile Chibok abductions, the practice of kidnapping children and forcing them to associate with the armed group has been prevalent. \u201cYoung girls are spotted in the markets, and nighttime raids drag them from their beds. In some cases, parents are killed in front of the girls during the process,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis is typically followed by an extended journey to a Boko Haram base in the forest where the girls are forced into early marriage and sexual slavery.\u201d The children\u2019s fund in its report also called on the community to help reintegrate children who were once under Boko haram\u2019s control, saying many are stigmatised and feared.",

Media reports say some youths in the region are also protesting against CAFECO, a company exploiting timber in Eyumojock Subdivision in Manyu Division. Grouped under what they named, the Njemaya Youth Movement for Positive Change, they confronted the mayor of the subdivision last week, demanding their share of royalties timber exploitation companies are expected to be paying to facilitate the development of their community. Despite Mayor Julius Nkom\u2019s promises to look into their grievances, the agitating youth later marched on the council on March 9, 2017, sent away its staff and shut it down. We gathered the Mayor was out of office when they youth got there and would not answer his phone when they tried to reach him. It is reported that he has been in hiding ever since the attack on his council.

We learned they were hinted that the planned   of this year\u2019s edition of the International Women\u2019s Day was not as effective as they wished because of the machinations of the DO. They believed the D.O paid some women to stage a march past in Tombel in order to thwart the plans of the outlawed consortium which claims to be running the English-speaking regions of Cameroon from abroad. In response, they set ablaze the podium of the ceremonial grand stand before they went after the Divisional officer. Inhabitants of the Dikome Balue locality in the oil-rich Ndian division also blocked the ruling CPDM party from holding an event in the area last week. The Cameroon Daily Journal reported that the event was supposed to be chaired by a parliamentarian of the party. Villagers, the report said, mounted a resistance, demanding the whereabouts of youths arrested from the municipality and taken to obscure unknown facilities. It should be noted that the outlawed   in the North West and South West regions recently called on the youth to form groups and associations and take initiatives to uphold the strike.

Before the departure of the President and elegant First Lady Chantal Biya, the Pope handed the president a sculpture which symbolizes peace and wished for Cameroon to continue in the path of peace. The aging Cameroonian leader for his part offered a sculpture of an elderly person, noting that the memory of the elders represents the wisdom of a country. It should be recalled that in the wake of the   that have brought education and the judiciary to a standstill in minority English-speaking Cameroon, Catholic Bishops issued a memo to President Biya. In   signed by George Nkuo, Bishop of Kumbo and President of the Bamenda Provincial Episcopal Conference\u00a0BAPEC, Cornelius Fontem Esua, Archbishop of Bamenda, Immanuel Bushu, Bishop of Buea, Andrew Nkea, Bishop of Mamfe, Agapitus Nfon, Bishop of Kumba the Bishops pointed out the genesis of the crisis noting that a major part of it, is the systematic erosion of the historical traditions and cultures of citizens in the protesting regions. The clergymen used the historically background of the country to demonstrate the root cause of the ongoing uprising..\u201d They wrote; It should be clear, from   brief historical sketch what the crux of the so-called Anglophone Problem is.\u00a0No matter what some self-appointed elite and spokespersons for Anglophone Cameroonians as well as government Ministers say in public, the participation of various strata of the population and the growing popularity of separatist movements among young and older members of the Anglophone community demonstrates that there is an Anglophone Problem. There is a consciousness among Anglophone Cameroonians that all is not well and something needs to be done about their plight.",

As of this notice, the Government of Cameroon has suspended cell phone and internet service in the Northwest and Southwest Regions. U.S. citizens in these areas should exercise caution and find alternate ways of keeping in touch with family and friends\u201d a statement from the US Embassy in Yaounde reads in part. In the message to US citizens issued on February 14, the embassy points out that even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.\u00a0US citizens in Cameroon, are urged, in the statement, to avoid areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations. \u201cReview your personal security plans; remain aware of your surroundings, be aware of local events and monitor local news stations for updates. Maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security and follow the instructions of local authorities.\u201d it says.

The outlawed Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium in a statement yesterday, suggested the government of Cameroon is contradicting the US embassies statement. In a message signed by iits leaders, Tassang Wilfred, Mark Bara and Tapang Ivo and widely published on social media on February 15, the Biya regime is accused of lying that the demonstrations are over. This according to the protest leaders, is an attempt by government to block a United Nations fact finding mission from coming to Cameroon for investigations. They attempt to justify their claims with the resurfacing the dissolved ad hoc committee that was set up by Prime Minister Philemon Yang to identify and solve the problems raised by teachers in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon. The chairman of the committee,   announced earlier in January that the committee\u2019s mission had ended, but he resurfaced this third week of February in a press conference to speak on behalf of the committee.",

    "text": "The Cameroonian legal mind who holds high ranking positions in international organisations was summoned through Jackson Kamnga, current Bar Council President. In a judicial convocation dated March 20, 2017, the Chief of the Central Services of Judicial Investigations at the headquarters of the national gendarmerie requests Kamga to invite Akere to come to SED on Wednesday March 22. The convocation, a copy of which Journal du Cameroun stumbled upon, does not state the reasons for the summons. The summons simply indicates that it is in relation to an investigation that had earlier been opened on the law practitioner. We gathered Akere, popularly known as a law abiding citizen will not show up at the SED tomorrow. We learned he had made plans to travel out of the country before the summons was issued. Our source said he has notified the security officials he would only be available on Friday when he would have returned from his trip abroad. Akere Muna alongside his brother Barrister Bernard Muna both former presidents of the Cameroon Bar Council, have been actively involved in the ongoing protests in the North West and South West regions of Cameroon. Ben Muna was first noticed during the last meeting government held with teachers\u2019 trade union leaders some of whom are on the run and in jail at the moment. He appeared at the office of the North West region at about midnight when reports reached him that striking teachers were being held at gunpoint to call of the strike. In a   to press, he blasted President Biya for stating that the form of the state cannot be changed. \u201cPresident Biya is not God\u2026.the future belongs to the youths and they should bloody fight.\u201d He said it is not President Biya who decides whether or not federation can be discussed as he is not the one who brought the two Cameroon\u2019s together.\u201d As for Akere who is currently under investigation, he has been vocal about the ongoing debate- challenging declarations made by President Paul Biya. It should be recalled that in addition stating on a widely watched program   he was present during the declaration of the independence of West Cameroon, he also wrote a couple of intriguing pieces. In   he rhetorically asked which Cameroon is one and indivisible- apparently challenging a statement from President Biya who stated earlier this year that Cameroon is one and indivisible and shall so remain. In yet   critical article, he stated \u201cyou can oppress all you want, but you cannot kill an ideal\u201d. In the wake of the arrests and detention of the leaders of the now proscribed Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium, the duo, Akere and Ben Muna took the lead in the struggle for their release. The latter currently leads a group of over 100 lawyers defending the detained activists who are due to appear in court on March 23. In addition to being a lawyer of international repute, Akere Muna is, according to  the Chairman of the International Anti-Corruption Conference Council. He is also the Sanctions Commissioner of the African Development Bank Group and a Member of the High-Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa. He previously served as the Vice-Chair of Transparency International, and he has presided over the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) of the African Union, the Pan African Lawyers Union. Though he is generally quoted as saying he has no political aspirations, pundits say the ongoing investigations could simply be part of government\u00a0machinations to put him in jail as has been the case with other high profile citizens who were cited in the past as potential successors of President Biya. Other observers argue the investigations must have been prompted by his apparent support to the ongoing protest in Anglophone Cameroon.  ",

While opening the colloquium, Rose Mbah Acha, Minister Delegate at the Presidency of the Republic in charge of the Supreme State Audit, Secretary General of the African Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, AFROSAI, said the objective of the audit is to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the institutions of governance and forest management in the Congo Basin and to formulate resolutions to improve Forest governance in the said geographical space. To do so, the sharing of ideas between heads of Supreme Audit Institutions in the countries hosting the forests of the Congo Basin is necessary in order to build on the conditions and modalities of the audit. Minister Mbah Acha said AFROSAI organized the consultation meeting on forest audit planning for the Congo Basin on three objectives aimed at, inter alia, involving the heads of senior public finance audit institutions in Congo Basin forests in the audit process and raising awareness on forest management mechanisms in the Congo Basin. \u201cIt will also be necessary to reach agreement on the terms and conditions of the audit, including the adoption of a budget and a timetable and a quality assurance mechanism for cooperative audit as well as adopt a cooperation agreement setting the framework for carrying out the said audit,\u201d she noted. The expected results at the end of the meeting were as follows: ensure that Heads of SAIs of countries involved in the cooperative Audit fully adhere to the project and take a commitment to complete it under the best condition; sign a cooperation agreement in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding between the SAIs to carry out the cooperative Audit of the Congo Basin Forest; adopt a budget and the timeframe for the audit; approve a consensus criteria and modalities for selecting the composition of audit teams and the approval of the quality assurance mechanism for the Cooperative Audit of the Congo Basin forest. The forests in the Congo Basin form the second largest forest mass in the world after the Amazon forest and account for about 16% of the world\u2019s forested area. To combine the satisfaction of the economic needs of populations and their States while promoting environmental protection, the countries where these forests are located have legal instruments and programmes to ensure better management of this natural heritage.",

Though the presidential decree did not contain the reasons for Ali\u2019s dismissal, many analysts are of the opinion that the decision is related to an incident of February 22 which led to the death of a young carpenter in Mutengene. Observers say sanctions would be in order if police officers suspected of abuses in the locality are tried according to the law. It should be recalled that police officers on patrol met a group of boys playing draughts at a small business avenue in Mutengene on the night of February 22. They are said to have surrounded the boys; provoking a brief argument after which the youngsters succeeded to slip out of the circle of officers. Eyewitness told Journal du Cameroun in February that one of the police officers caught up with one of the fleeing boys who turned around and demanded the reason they are being hunted down. \u201cAn argument ensued, leading to death of the youngster who was shot at point-blank range. A woman who suffering from mental derangement is the one who shouted out to the other boys that one of their friends had been shot,\u201d our source said. We gathered the officer and all others who were hunting down the boys became the hunted as they fled in diverse directions. The irate youths carried the corpse of the youngster from the Quarter 2 neighbourhood to the police station. All the police officers at the station equally vamoosed at the site of the corpse-carrying youths. The youths wreaked havoc on the police station. They set some cars ablaze and later went on to set fire on the francophone section of GBHS Mutengene.

    "text": "Issa Tchiroma Bakary, Cameroon\u2019s government spokesman, was speaking on March 29 in a press conference in reaction to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesperson\u2019s claims of forceful repatriation by Cameroon of Nigerian refugees since the beginning of the year 2016. The UNHCR spokesperson,Babar Baloch, had  during a press conference granted on March 21, 2017 in Geneva, that some refugees who were arrested during a military attack against the Boko Haram insurgency, were transported in trucks to a camp of the displaced persons at Banki. He said among those forcibly returned, was a one year old child and a woman who was nine months pregnant who later put to birth a day after their arrival at Banki. Issa Tchiroma who is also Cameroon\u2019s Minister of communication refuted the allegations stating that they are ungrounded and particularly unjust in describing a country like Cameroon whose meritorious efforts to host refugees are unanimously lauded, including by the High Commissioner for Refugees. With regard to the facts on the ground, Tchiroma said; \u201cit is important to highlight that, on March 20, 2017, while fleeing the Nigerian army operations against the Boko Haram terrorist group, 841 Nigerian nationals, including 154 men, 288 women and 399 children, found themselves in Cameroon. They were welcomed by the elements of the Cameroonian army based in the Lafia locality, who, with the means at their disposal, gave them all the necessary assistance in terms of food and medical care. Considering the general fatigue conditions of these refugees, in which some sustained injuries through bullets, coupled with the remote location of the Minawao camp, the Cameroonian authorities, under the effective supervision of the local HCR bureau and in collaboration with the relevant Nigerian authorities, undertook to organise their safe return in their country. For this purpose, civilian trucks were requisitioned in support of military vehicles. In all, 905 Nigerian nationals (over sixty new refugees who were added to the other 841), were regrouped and transported to Banki in Nigeria, and handed over to the Nigerian authorities, in the morning of March 21, 2017. None of them expressed the desire to stay in Cameroon\u201d. The government\u2019s spokesman stated that all these operations took place in strict compliance with the provisions contained in the Tripartite Agreement signed on March 2, 2017 as part of the voluntary return of Nigerian refugees living in Cameroon. To Tchiroma, Cameroon has no lesson to learn from anyone in matters of hospitality. \u201cThe country has always hosted a good number of refugees who find asylum in our territory. The local Cameroonian authorities, known for their legendary hospitality and solidarity, have always spontaneously hosted these helpless persons. Notwithstanding the end of conflicts which justified their departure from their country of origin, many refugees have nevertheless chosen to stay in Cameroon. Today, Cameroon hosts over 550,000 refugees, mostly nationals of the Central African Republic and Nigeria. But there are also some former Chadian, Rwandan and Burundian refugees. With regard to Nigerian refugees, more than 87,000 persons are currently present in Cameroon. Over 60,000 of these Nigerian refugees are hosted in the Minawao camp, initially set up for 20, 000 people and whose hosting capacity is today far exceeded. Thousands of other Nigerian refugees are received by host families, yet with very limited resources\u201d. He added that the influx of refugees has been a particularly heavy burden for public authorities, as well as host communities who do not have enough resources but have to bear considerable pressure. The paramount responsibility of the Cameroonian Government, he went on, relates to its own populations, who are suffering a great deal as a result of the current security crisis and its consequences. To him, rather than being criticised, Cameroon needs an increased support from the international community to be able to bear the burden of the humanitarian crisis, in order to ensure decent living conditions and guarantee a promising future to refugees and displaced persons. He said the aforementioned ungrounded allegations can offend and frustrate the populations who have always showcased generosity towards refugees.",

Six out of the thirty members of the Commission were present at a meeting with various stakeholders and government officials of the South West Region, at the Buea Council Town Hall to have a frank discussion with inhabitants of Buea living in the heart of the crisis. The move was in an effort to have first-hand testimonies and concrete examples of violations they suffered. Speaking at the meeting, the South West Regional Secretary for the National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms, NCHRF, Christopher Tambe Tiku, disclosed that contrary to the opinion by a plethora of critics that the Commission is heavily in favour of the government, it is a completely independent body that does its own investigations, determines where human rights have been trampled upon and renders findings to the courts for legal action to be taken on the perpetrators. The members of the commission come from a wide spectrum of Cameroon\u2019s society including civil society organizations, the Cameroon Bar Association, workers\u2019 trade unions and penitentiary administration. During presentations by attendees at the gathering, the issue of the severe violation of children\u2019s rights was hammered upon due to their 2-month stay out of school. The   during the November strike was equally a major point of debate as well as the alleged death of the victim. The internet blackout in the North West and South West Regions as well as the arbitrary arrests and detentions of individuals sympathetic to the causes of the striking lawyers and teachers were also addressed. The Vice Chairman of the  , Professor James Kobila, told reporters in an interview that they had come to the South West Region to enable all parties, whether government of civil, to report all cases of violations of human rights over the past two months. He gave to understanding that the grievances tabled to government by the Anglophones stem from deeply rooted problems but that their job is to identify the root causes and the individuals responsible. He said they would question some persons for better understanding of the problem and urged stakeholders on both sides of the divide to respect the rights of the others. The Commission equally has the task of visiting prisons and detention centers around the South West region to feel the reality of prisoners and inspect the conditions of detention. They are also to visit sites where violence took place, with promises of doing a thorough job and making sure that justice is served and law breakers are punished accordingly.",

Going by official sources, President Biya created the commission to reinforce Cameroon\u2019s unique identity in the African continent. Cameroon stands out privileged amidst other countries within and without Africa, with English and French as Cameroon\u2019s two official languages \u2013 with equal status, and over 250 national languages. According to the missions assigned to the Commission, members will work to reinforce national unity and national integration. The team headed by Peter Mafany Musonge will not only strengthen existing bilingualism (official languages of English and French) but will as well uphold the rich and diverse cultures of the country in the bid to wipe out the sense and feeling of superiority or inferiority that greatly frustrates the essence of living together. It is hoped that Cameroonians from all backgrounds will be expected to feel important through the commission, have a sense of belonging and hopefully jointly contribute to the social, political, cultural and economic development of the country. The Commission will also have to complement the work of other existing structures created to champion bilingualism and multiculturalism in the country like the pilot linguistic centres and the ministry of arts and culture. While the Commission would be working to live up to these expectations, other segments of society, notably the private sector, are expected to chip in contributions for collective success. Pundits believe promoting bilingualism and multiculturalism in Cameroon cannot solely be an affair of government. The presidential decree creating the commission however states that in no way and on no occasion shall the Commission be responsible for regulating political problems. \u201cThe commission will work to ensure harmonious promotion and respect of cultures where all feel proud and useful for an indivisible Cameroon\u201d the decree reads.",

In order to venerate himself from the people\u2019s criticism, the mayor said out of 18 top positions in the Buea Council, 7 of them are occupied by people from the North West region, an indication that he is practicing national integration. He equally added that he is a son of North West and has been accepted by the people. He urged the people to live as one regardless of their region of origin and tribes. Observers hold that the Mayor is trying to clean an already damaged image in the face of ongoing crisis which he has been strongly criticised for his alleged role in the arrest of youths in Buea.",

She said despite being deprived of their freedom for 65 days, and March 23 being their third court appearance, the military court took delight in wasting time on things which could have been done before the case hearing date. The political activist said the court spent time verifying names and identifying 27 young men who were arrested after the  of December 8. She equally wondered why the judges and state counsels handling the case are not bilingual. \u201cSurely there is a bilingual judge somewhere in the Cameroonian court system who could hear a case in English and a state counsel that could argue it without needing translation? Is this not precisely what got us here in the first place?\u201d she probed. Walla also pointed out the absence of microphones in the court room. \u201cWe strain in the court room to hear the judge, the lawyers and the defendants. In this country where we spend billions to throw a state party, no one thought we might need microphones in court?\u201d On the court\u2019s size, Walla questioned the use of a small court room which could not afford seats to half of the people who wish to attend. \u201cThe court room is too small to contain all the defendants, the benches are too few to contain all the lawyers, even the defendants are squeezed tight on the benches they occupy. Why does this system insist on showing its lack of planning and organization to the entire world\u201d she asked. In the end, the CPP boss opined that all these flaws are pointer to government\u2019s delay strategic technique to wear down the Anglophone crisis through violence, fear, and time. She urged Cameroonians not to get tired in fighting for justice and the type of Cameroon they wish to pass on to their children.

    "title": "Anglophone Protests: Baptist Convention follows Catholics to Bamenda Court April 21",
    "text": "The Cameroon Baptist Convention summoned by the Bamenda Court of First Instance while the PCC moderator will appear before the Buea High Court on Monday April 24. Rev.\u00a0Godwill Ncham Chiatoh, Executive President of the Cameroon Baptist Convention is expected to appear before the Bamenda Court of First Instance on Friday April 21 at 9am alongside three bishops of the Catholic Church- Cornelius Fontem Esua, Archbishop of Bamenda, Michael Bibi, Auxiliary Bishop of Bamenda, George Nkuo, Bishop of Kumbo and some reverend fathers who head catholic secondary schools. According to a summons   stumbled upon, the Cameroon Baptist Convention which runs several schools and hospitals is facing the same charges levied on the Catholic church by a newly created \u201cAnglophone Parents\u2019 Consortium\u201d represented by two high ranking officers of the Cameroon army and a certain Barrister Julius Achu. We gathered that authorities of the CBC and those of the Catholic Church are being sued for allegedly supporting the on-going protests against a perceived marginalisation of English-speaking Cameroon. Both churches are being sued to pay 150billion FCFA each to the organisation for damages. Like the suit against the Catholic Church made public last week, that of the CBC says the church is being sued by a \u201cConsortium of parents\u201d. Many parents in the North West and South West however question the legality of the organisation. Some fanatics of the on-going protest argue the dubious suites have been masterminded by Paul Atanga Nji, Minister Delegate at the Presidency in Charge of Special Duties, reportedly notorious of trying to discredit the protests- the allegations are far from proven. The clergy of both churches, according to the subpoenas by the Bamenda Court of First Instance, are accused of failing to ask parents to send their children to school despite collecting school fees from them. The complainants claim in the separate summonses that the action is an offence contrary to and punishable under section 151 of the Penal Code. The CBC Executive President, Bishops Cornelius Fontem Esua, Bishop Michael, Bishop George Nkuo after a meeting with others signed a joint release indicating that the non-resumption of school was as a result of the unresolved political problem. According to the complainants, is an offence contrary to and punishable under section 157(a)of the Penal Code. They are also accused of refusing to pay salaries of teachers in mission schools for several months, an offence contrary to and punishable under section 183(2) of the Penal Code, according to the plaintiffs. Other counts include release of communiqu\u00e9 which \u201cpropagated false information and puts national Unity in danger\u201d among others. In reaction to the summons, the Catholic Bishops issued a statement, noting that the church is not aware of the existence of any \u2018consortium of parents\u2019. The statement which was read in churches on Easter Sunday, said the Bishops and fathers will honour the summons nonetheless. Archbishop Samuel Kleda, President of National Episcopal Conference for his part, argues the Catholic Church did not call the strike and cannot be accused today of preventing students from going to school. He questioned why the church was targeted when schools have been paralyzed in almost all sectors both in Public, Private and Confessional schools. The Anglophone Civil Society Consortium which has been coordinating the strike since November 2016 is currently multiplying calls on citizens to stage a street protest on April 21 when the clergy are expected to appear in court. Reports from Bamenda say Christians are responding positively to the call. A statement circulating on social media and attributed to Barrister Akere Muna, casts doubts on the legality of the suit against the clergy. The statement says \u201clegally the case has no wings and won\u2019t fly\u201d. The legal luminary tweeted April 17 \u201cHappy Easter everyone, with a special thought to our fearless bishops. If only everyone could have the same commitment for love and justice\u201d. Retired Colonel Tamabang Simon Che, one of the names plaintiffs on the summons is said to have washed his hands off the matter, noting that he is not the author of the complaint and has nothing to do with it. Rt. Rev. Fonki Samuel Forba, like Catholic bishops, is calling on christians to pray for him as he represents the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon at the Buea High Court next Monday. Meanwhile Barrister Julius Achu, counsel of the complainants, says his life is in danger. He told Equinoxe TV yesterday that some unidentified people have declared him \u201cwanted dead or alive\u201d. He said the social media is flooded with a photo of him marked with a red cross on his forehead and with the inscription, \u201cwanted dead or alive.\u201d Government is yet to make an official statement on the issue.

    "text": "The SDF has been advocating the return to a federal system of government for Cameroon since the early nineties. Some officials of the party have repeatedly stated on several occasions that government only introduced decentralisation in the 1996 constitution as an excuse to turn away from federalism. The upcoming sensitisation campaign is being organised at time when a pressure group is also pressing for the return to federalism as a prerequisite for them to end a prolonged strike taking place in the English-speaking regions of the country. The Anglophone Civil Society Organisation, which transformed a sit-down strike by teachers and lawyers into a regional movement was outlawed on January 17, 2017. Its leaders at large are coordinating the strike from abroad while those arrested are facing trial for terrorism, rebellion, unlawful assembly etc. The campaign which is going to include a street march, according to the main organiser, Jean Michel Nintcheu, Member of Parliament who doubles as Regional Chairman of the party for the Littoral, will focus on portraying this form of government as a model of national unity. The campaign which speculators fear might meet with resistance from security forces, comes at a time when public opinion holds that top government officials who are against this form of government, have deceived citizens in the French-speaking part of the country to believe that federation is synonymous to separation- some of them, commentators say, have been made that to believe that federalism is a step towards secession. This, they argue, is in a bid to prevent citizens of the francophone regions from supporting the on-going protest in the English-speaking regions. The leaders of the   however hold the strike would come to an end only when government decides to organise a referendum which would possibly see the mutation of form of the state to that which was put in place during the unification of West and East Cameroon 1961.

    "text": "Celebrations marking the 51  National Youth Day in the English speaking regions of Cameroon Saturday, February 11, 2017 witnessed a very low turnout as compared to previous years following a call for a boycott from the outlawed Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium, CACSC. Ahead of the Youth Day festivities, CACSC\u00a0had urged all West Cameroonians to mark 11 February as a national day of mourning to highlight the grievances of people living in English areas. In a message, Tassang Wilfred, the executive secretary of the Cameroon Teachers Trade union (CATTU), one of the leaders of Consortium affirmed that the Youth Day will be boycotted in Anglophone Cameroon. He alleged the government was \u201cferrying in Francophone children from other regions and young police recruits to come and celebrate in Anglophone regions.\u201d In Buea, capital of the South West Region, very few participated in the march-past which is said to lasted well below 30 minutes. According to reports, students from CEFAM, the police school in Mutengene, Francophone students from some colleges and from HTTTC Kumba, newly recruited military cadets are said to have disguised as students and marched as many times as possible. In Ndop, Ngoketunjia Division which witnessed scenes and violence and protests, reports indicated that it took just 3 minutes for the exercise which usually takes two to three hours as only teachers and soldiers took part. At the Kumbo municipal stadium, only a handful of fearful teachers and about 14 students standing with their parents reported for the Youth Day. In Wum, Menchum Division, only the SDO and his Etat Major took part at the celebrations marking the 51  Youth Day. In Ndu, Donga Mantung Division, only traditional rulers were reported at the Grand Stand. Five policemen, four gendarmes, no councillor, no pupils, no political party yet! In Nkambe, only soldiers could be seen at Grand Stand. The South West and North West Cameroon\u2019s only English-speaking regions for months. Lawyers, teachers and students have been striking and protesting since October 2016 against perceived marginalisation and the use of French in courts and schools in the regions. As the Youth Day gradually drew to an end, a message from another leader from of the Consortium, Mark Barata read: \u201cWhen we are united, we beat them. For the first time in history since our parents voted in good faith to join an independent country called La Republique du Cameroun based on some terms which were never materialised as I write, we have succeeded in puncturing the 11th February plebiscite day. History will record this generation as those who sever the links with 11th February bad taste. Our parents gone before us marked with the sign of faith shall be happy with us. Reports from Southern Cameroons say from the Northern to the Southern zones in Southern Cameroons, all communities and cities are dead. No activity is taking place. Our people are indoors. No celebration of whatsoever. However, we could only see floods of military parading our empty and dead streets with some colonial administrators and some Southern Cameroons slave elite who have hired some Francophones trying to march past in few areas so as to sabotage our struggle. All Southern Cameroonians are home praying and chatting the way forward. The civil resistance is real. Meanwhile in Pamol Lobe, our correspondence says three vehicles stationed in front of the mill to transport workers have been there since morning empty. All workers are home. Reports just got to us that Akwaya grandstand has been burnt down because the D O paid some illiterates who attempted to march but it failed. We condemn the DO for provoking our people and we also call our people everywhere to not destroy our institutions and infrastructures. We need these buildings. Our people should please show maximum restraint. The Government is facing worldwide condemnation for the way it is handling protests especially as authorities have been criticised for their decision to in the English speaking areas. The block, implemented earlier in January, is forcing Anglophones to travel to French speaking regions where they can use the internet. Some analysts have claimed authorities are failing to address people\u2019s that go beyond the use of French in courts and schools. The internet shutdown has now intensified grievances; with claims it was now affecting local businesses.",

    "text": "Franklyn Sone Bayen, journalist and media consultant, stated on his Facebook wall during the weekend that the MP was last seen last week at the Commercial Avenue in Bamenda. According Bayen\u2019s account, Hon. Wirba never showed up for his driver to take him home later that afternoon. He only called the driver several hours after he had gone incommunicado, and simply ordered him to drive the car home. The MP, Bayen said, only made the call when he was \u201csafely across the border.\u201d Contacted for clarifications on the supposed escape of the MP who had been listed for arrest according to several newspaper reports, Denis Nkemlemo, his party\u2019s Communication Officer simply said he cannot say whether or not the information is accurate. Hon. Wirba might have been seen as endorsing separatist movements when he declared in parliament in November 2016 that his observation of the marginalisation of citizens of the North West and South West regions have given him reason to think that secessionists are right. \u201c\u2026those who are saying Cameroon should go in two ways are right. They are correct!\u201d he said during his outbursts which even Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, the House Speaker failed to control. He condemned government for treating citizens of the North West and South West regions \u201clike slaves and a captured people\u201d, stressing that resisting the injustices of the predominantly Francophone government has become a duty. The MP became more popular among English-speaking Cameroonians after a  of the address in parliament went viral on social media. He later defied a government ban on a rally he had planned to hold in the town of Kumbo. A crowd of more than 5000 people attended the rally during which, Mancho Bibixy, one of the currently detained leaders of the on-going protest in the Anglophone regions was guest speaker. They both talked about liberation of the people of Former British Southern Cameroons, otherwise referred to as West Cameroon (North West and South West regions). He had announced at the end of the rally that he was going to hold similar public meetings in Kumba and Buea in the South West region and another one in Bamenda, Chieftown of the North West regions. But shortly after the Kumbo meeting, government began arresting leaders and sympathisers of the on-going Anglophone protest. Even Ayah Paul Abine, a sitting Supreme Court magistrate was arrested like a common thief and taken to the gendamerie headquarters manu militari, as he said in a statement early this month. This apparently caused the tough-talking MP to shrink back into his shell as nothing was ever to be said about the announced grand rallies to this day. were rife that Hon. Wirba\u2019 immunity was going to be lifted during the March session of Parliament which opens today in Yaounde- a move which would facilitate his arrest and trail. His escape comes after that of Bobga Harmony Mbuton, one of the leaders of the lawyers\u2019 strike which merged with a teachers\u2019 sit-down strike and later degenerated into the current regional uprising. Tassang Wilfred, leader of the Cameroon Teachers Trade Union, who went into hiding after the arrest on January 17, 2017 of some leaders of the protests, had earlier announced in a video circulating online that he was equally trying to flee to the US where he was expected to attend a meeting in Houston, Texas.

He spoke with them via Skype after several failed attempts to get them on phone; the release said. Going by the interim leaders, the former minister of finance acknowledged the existence of the issues raised by the English speaking Cameroonians which centres mainly on \u201chalf a century of gross inequality, marginalisation and unfair distribution of power and wealth in the \u201cUnitary\u201d state. The economist also pointed out that the internet shutdown in Anglophone regions will lead to an economic meltdown if it continues for a few months, according to the release signed by the consortium\u2019s two interim leaders. They were all agreed that the release of detained leaders of the Consortium should be secured. Tsimi suggested that the consortium should focus on the   leaders first, and discuss the release of other detainees later. He noted that it was vital for dialogue to begin as soon as possible. Mark and Ivo on their part, pushed further; stating that detained leaders, Felix Agbor \u2018Balla\u2019 Kongho, Fontem Neba and those on the run, Wilfred Tassang, Eyambe Elias and James Abangma must be present on the dialogue table to find solutions to the \u2018Anglophone Problem\u2019. Tsimi, they said, gave to understanding that during the dialogue, the government bench would be made up of key ministers and diplomats from the presidency. He also noted that calls for the demilitarisation of Anglophone regions cannot be heeded because the regions do not constitute an independent country. The interim consortium leaders, going by the release, did not leave the online discussion without informing the government envoy that though the consortium is pushing for a two-state federation, observations show a majority of English-speaking Cameroonians want total independence. The release says Tsimi promised to give feedback of the talks to President Paul Biya.",

I have never talked to one of the girls about their reasons. \u201cAs a mediator, it is not part of my mandate to force them to return home.\u201d Mustapha reportedly told Nigerian journalists shortly after the rescue negotiations of 82 Chibok school girls. Mustapha said the next stage of negotiations will be on how to restore lasting peace to the North-East. \u201cWe are not just talking; we are still actively working towards peace. Even though we have got some of the girls back, I don\u2019t feel we have made much progress. After the release of the girls, how many hundreds have been killed by suicide bombings?\u201d \u201cWhile Boko Haram may indeed hold out in releasing all of the hostages to maintain some form of leverage, the reality is that the girls have limited value to the sect outside of public relations capital and are likely placing a strain on resources,\u201d\u00a0He added. Speaking on the issue, many psychologists have said the girls who refuse to leave their captors might have developed Stockholm syndrome. \u201cStockholm syndrome must have made them to identify with captors and want to remain. Some are afraid of what to expect, the unknown. We don\u2019t know how much influence their husbands have in coercing them not to go back.\u201d Meanwhile, Nigeria has donated drugs and other essential commodities to an undisclosed medical facility for the rehabilitation of the 82 rescued Chibok school girls.",
